Your task is to: With a textbook turn on a lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding textbook, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up textbook and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up textbook, find and turn on lamp
