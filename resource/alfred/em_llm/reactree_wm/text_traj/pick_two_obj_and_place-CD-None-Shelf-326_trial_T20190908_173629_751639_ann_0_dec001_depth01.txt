Your task is to: To move two disks on the desk to the shelf on the bottom right of the desk.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding disk, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up disk, place disk on shelf, Find and pick up disk away from shelf, and place disk on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up disk, place disk on shelf, Find and pick up disk away from shelf, place disk on shelf
