You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on coffee table, Find and pick up box away from coffee table, and place box on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
