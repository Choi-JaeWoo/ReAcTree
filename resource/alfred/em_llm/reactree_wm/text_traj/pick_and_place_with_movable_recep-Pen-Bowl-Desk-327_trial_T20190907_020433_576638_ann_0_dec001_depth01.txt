Your task is to: Place a bowl holding a pen onto a white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl on table, and place pen on bowl near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl on table, place pen on bowl near table
