Your task is to: Put a slice of cooked tomato in a sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of cooked tomato, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, and place tomato in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, place tomato in sink basin
