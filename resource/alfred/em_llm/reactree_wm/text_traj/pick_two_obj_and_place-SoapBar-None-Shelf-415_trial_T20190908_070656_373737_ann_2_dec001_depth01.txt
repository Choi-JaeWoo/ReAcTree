Your task is to: Place two bars of soap on a shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding any soap, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap, place soap on shelf, find and pick up soap away from shelf, and place soap on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, place soap on shelf, find and pick up soap away from shelf, place soap on shelf
