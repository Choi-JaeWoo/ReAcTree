Your task is to: Put a cooked egg in a garbage can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
Think: Since I’m not holding egg, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, heat and pick up egg, and place egg in garbage can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, heat and pick up egg, place egg in garbage can
