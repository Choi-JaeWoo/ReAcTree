Your task is to: Put a wet bar of soap in the bath tub. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding bar of soap, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bar of soap, clean and pick up bar of soap, and place bar of soap in bath tub.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bar of soap, clean and pick up bar of soap, place bar of soap in bath tub
