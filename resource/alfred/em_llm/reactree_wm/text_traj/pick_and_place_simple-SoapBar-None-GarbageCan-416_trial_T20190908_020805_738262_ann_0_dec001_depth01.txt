Your task is to: put a bar of soap into the trash can
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bar of soap, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap and place soap in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, place soap in trash can
