Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge, place sponge in bathtub, Find and pick up sponge away from bathtub, and place sponge in bathtub.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge in bathtub, Find and pick up sponge away from bathtub, place sponge in bathtub
