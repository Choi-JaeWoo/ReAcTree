Your task is to: put two cell phones in to the top desk drawer
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the cell phone, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cell phone, place cell phone in drawer, find and pick up cell phone away from drawer, and place cell phone in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cell phone, place cell phone in drawer, find and pick up cell phone away from drawer, place cell phone in drawer
