Your task is to: Put a cold pan on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding the pan, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, cool and pick up pan, and place pan on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, cool and pick up pan, place pan on table
