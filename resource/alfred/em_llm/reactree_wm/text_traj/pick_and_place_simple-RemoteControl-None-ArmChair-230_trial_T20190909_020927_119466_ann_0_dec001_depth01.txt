Your task is to: Move the remote to the brown chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on brown chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
