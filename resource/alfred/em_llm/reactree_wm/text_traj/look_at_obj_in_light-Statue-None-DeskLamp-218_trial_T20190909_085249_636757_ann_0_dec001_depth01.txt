Your task is to: Examine a statue by the light of a small lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding statue, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
