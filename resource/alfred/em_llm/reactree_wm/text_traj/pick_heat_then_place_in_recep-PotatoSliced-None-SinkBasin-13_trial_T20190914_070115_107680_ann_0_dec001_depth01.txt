Your task is to: drop a cooked potato slice in the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cook and pick up potato, and place potato in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cook and pick up potato, place potato in sink basin
