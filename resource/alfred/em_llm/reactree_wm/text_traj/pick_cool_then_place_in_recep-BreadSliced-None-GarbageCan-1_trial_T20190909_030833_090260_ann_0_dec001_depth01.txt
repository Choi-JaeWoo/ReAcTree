Your task is to: Put a cold slice of bread in the trash.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of bread, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, and place bread in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, place bread in trash can
