Your task is to: Pick up a disc and turn a lamp on.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Desk (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding disc, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up disc and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up disc, find and turn on lamp
