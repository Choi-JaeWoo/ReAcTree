Your task is to: Place a microwaved potato to the left of the lettuce on the shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
Think: Since I’m not holding a microwaved potato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, and place potato to the left of the lettuce on the shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, place potato to the left of the lettuce on the shelf
