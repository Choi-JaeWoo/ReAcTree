Your task is to: Place chilled wine onto the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27).
Think: Since I’m not holding wine, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up wine, cool and pick up wine, and place wine on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up wine, cool and pick up wine, place wine on counter
