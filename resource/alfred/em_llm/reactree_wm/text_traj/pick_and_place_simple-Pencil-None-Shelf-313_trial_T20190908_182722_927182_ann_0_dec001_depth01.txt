Your task is to: move the pencil from the top of the stand to the shelf on the left of the stand
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding pencil, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pencil and place pencil on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
