Your task is to: Put a cooked piece of apple in a fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding a piece of apple, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, and place apple in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, and place apple in fridge.
