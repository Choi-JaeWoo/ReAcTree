Your task is to: To cool a potato slice plus place it in the trash can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding a potato slice, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, and place potato in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, place potato in trash can
