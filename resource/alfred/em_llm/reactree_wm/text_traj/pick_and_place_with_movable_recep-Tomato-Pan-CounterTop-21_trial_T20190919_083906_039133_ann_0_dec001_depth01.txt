Your task is to: move the pan from the stove to the counter, put the tomato in the pan
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Move pan from stove to counter, and put tomato in pan.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: move pan from stove to counter, put tomato in pan
