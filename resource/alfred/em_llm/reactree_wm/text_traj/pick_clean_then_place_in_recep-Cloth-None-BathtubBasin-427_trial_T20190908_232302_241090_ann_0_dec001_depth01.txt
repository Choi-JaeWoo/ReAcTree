Your task is to: Put a cleaned washcloth in the tub.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding washcloth, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up washcloth, clean and pick up washcloth, and place washcloth in tub.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up washcloth, clean and pick up washcloth, place washcloth in tub
