Your task is to: Take out an apple from the microwave, chilled it and put it in the bin
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding the apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, cool and pick up apple, and place apple in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, cool and pick up apple, place apple in trash can
