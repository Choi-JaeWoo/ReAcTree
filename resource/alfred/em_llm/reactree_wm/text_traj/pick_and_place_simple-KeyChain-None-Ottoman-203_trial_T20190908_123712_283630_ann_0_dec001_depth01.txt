Your task is to: Put the keys on the ottoman.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys and place keys on ottoman.
OK.
