Your task is to: Place slices of bread into the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of bread, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, place bread in fridge, find and pick up bread away from fridge, and place bread in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, place bread in fridge, find and pick up bread away from fridge, place bread in fridge
