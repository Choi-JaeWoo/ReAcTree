You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Desk (1, 2), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding alarm clock, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up alarm clock and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
