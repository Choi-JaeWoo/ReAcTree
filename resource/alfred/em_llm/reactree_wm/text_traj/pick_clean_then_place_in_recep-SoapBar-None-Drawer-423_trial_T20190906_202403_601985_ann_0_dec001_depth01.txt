Your task is to: Put a clean bar of soap into the cabinet drawer
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding soap, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap, clean and pick up soap, and place soap in cabinet drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, clean and pick up soap, place soap in cabinet drawer
