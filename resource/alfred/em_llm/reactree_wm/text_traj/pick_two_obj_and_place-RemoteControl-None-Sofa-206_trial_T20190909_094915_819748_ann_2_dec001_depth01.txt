Your task is to: Putting two remotes on a sofa
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on sofa, Find and pick up remote away from sofa, and place remote on sofa.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on sofa, Find and pick up remote away from sofa, and place remote on sofa
