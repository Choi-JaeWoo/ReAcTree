Your task is to: Put a mug with a pen in it on the long table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug on table, find and pick up pen, and place pen in mug near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug on table, find and pick up pen, place pen in mug near table
