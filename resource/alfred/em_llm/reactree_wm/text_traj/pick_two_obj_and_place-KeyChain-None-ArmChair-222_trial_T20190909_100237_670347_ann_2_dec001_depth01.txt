Your task is to: put two pairs of keys in the chair
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys in chair, Find and pick up keys away from chair, and place keys in chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys in chair, find and pick up keys away from chair, place keys in chair
