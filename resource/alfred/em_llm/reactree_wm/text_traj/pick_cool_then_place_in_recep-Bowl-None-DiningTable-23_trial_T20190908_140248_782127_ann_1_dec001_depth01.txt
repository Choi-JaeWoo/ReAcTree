Your task is to: Put the chilled bowl on the table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, cool and pick up bowl, and place bowl on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, cool and pick up bowl, place bowl on table
