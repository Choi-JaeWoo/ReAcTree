Your task is to: Pick up a clock and turn on the lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding clock, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up clock and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up clock, find and turn on lamp
