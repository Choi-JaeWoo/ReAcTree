Your task is to: Pick up a cushion from the couch and turn on the lamp. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding cushion, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cushion and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
