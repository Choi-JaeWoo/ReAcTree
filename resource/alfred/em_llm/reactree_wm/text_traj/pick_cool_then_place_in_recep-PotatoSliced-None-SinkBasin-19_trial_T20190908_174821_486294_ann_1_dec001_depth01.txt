Your task is to: Put a cold slice of potato in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of potato, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, and place potato in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, place potato in sink
