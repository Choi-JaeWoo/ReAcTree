Your task is to: Put a chilled green apple on the table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding the green apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up green apple, cool and pick up green apple, and place green apple on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up green apple, cool and pick up green apple, place green apple on table
