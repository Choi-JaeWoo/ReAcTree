Your task is to: Put two sponges on the top shelf of a metal shelving unit.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Cart (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the sponge, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge, place sponge on metal shelf, Find and pick up sponge away from metal shelf, and place sponge on metal shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge on metal shelf, Find and pick up sponge away from metal shelf, place sponge on metal shelf
