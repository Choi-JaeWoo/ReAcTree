Your task is to: Move two rags from the bathtub to the sink. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding any rags, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up rag, place rag in sink basin, find and pick up rag, and place rag in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up rag, place rag in sink basin, find and pick up rag, place rag in sink basin
