Your task is to: Move the disc from the dresser to the top shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding disc, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up disc and place disc on top shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up disc, place disc on top shelf
