Your task is to: place two remote controller's on top of the coffee table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote controller, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote controller, place remote controller on coffee table, Find and pick up remote controller away from coffee table, and place remote controller on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote controller, place remote controller on coffee table, Find and pick up remote controller away from coffee table, place remote controller on coffee table
