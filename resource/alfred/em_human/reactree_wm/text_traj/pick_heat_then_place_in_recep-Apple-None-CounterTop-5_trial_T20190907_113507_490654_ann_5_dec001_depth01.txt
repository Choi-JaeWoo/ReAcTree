Your task is to: cook the apple in the microwave, put it on the counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, and place apple on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, place apple on counter
