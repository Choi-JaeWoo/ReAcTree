Your task is to: Place two slices of lettuce in the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of lettuce, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in fridge, find and pick up lettuce away from fridge, and place lettuce in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in fridge, find and pick up lettuce away from fridge, place lettuce in fridge
