Your task is to: Put two compact disks in the safe.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Safe (1), LaundryHamper (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a compact disk, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up compact disk, place compact disk in safe, Find and pick up compact disk away from safe, and place compact disk in safe.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up compact disk, place compact disk in safe, Find and pick up compact disk away from safe, place compact disk in safe
