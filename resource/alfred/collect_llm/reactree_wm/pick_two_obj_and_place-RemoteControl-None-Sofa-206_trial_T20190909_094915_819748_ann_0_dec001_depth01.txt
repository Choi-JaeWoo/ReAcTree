Your task is to: Place two remote controllers on the couch
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a remote controller, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote controller, place remote controller on couch, find and pick up remote controller away from couch, and place remote controller on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote controller, place remote controller on couch, find and pick up remote controller away from couch, place remote controller on couch
