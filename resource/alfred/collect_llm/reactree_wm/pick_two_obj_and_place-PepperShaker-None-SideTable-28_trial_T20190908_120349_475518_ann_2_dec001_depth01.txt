Your task is to: Place two salt shakers on black shelves next to counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding salt shakers, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up salt shakers, place salt shakers on black shelves, and place salt shakers next to counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up salt shakers, place salt shakers on black shelves, place salt shakers next to counter
