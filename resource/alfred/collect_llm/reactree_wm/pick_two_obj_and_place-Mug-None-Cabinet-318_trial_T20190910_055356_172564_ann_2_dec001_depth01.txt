Your task is to: Pick up the cups on the desk and place them in the desk drawer.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cups, place cups on desk, find and pick up cups, and place cups in desk drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cups, place cups on desk, find and pick up cups, place cups in desk drawer
