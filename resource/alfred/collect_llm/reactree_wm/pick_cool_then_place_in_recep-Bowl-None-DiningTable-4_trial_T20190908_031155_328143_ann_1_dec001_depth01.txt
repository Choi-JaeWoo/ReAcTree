Your task is to: Put a cold bowl near the bread on the table across the fridge. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, cool and pick up bowl, and place bowl on table near bread.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, cool and pick up bowl, place bowl on table near bread
