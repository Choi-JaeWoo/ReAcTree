Your task is to: Move a pen and cup to a dresser.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding pen and cup, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen and cup and place pen and cup on dresser.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pen and cup, place pen and cup on dresser
