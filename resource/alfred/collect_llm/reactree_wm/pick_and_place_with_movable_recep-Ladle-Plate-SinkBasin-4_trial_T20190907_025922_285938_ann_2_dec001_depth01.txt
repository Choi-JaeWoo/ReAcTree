Your task is to: place a plate with a spoon on it inside the kitchen sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate in sink basin, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon on plate near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate in sink basin, find and pick up spoon, place spoon on plate near sink basin
