Your task is to: Place a box with a card on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on table, and find and pick up card.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on table, find and pick up card
