Your task is to: Put a heated plate with a statue on it on the round table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, heat and pick up plate, and place plate on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, heat and pick up plate, place plate on table
