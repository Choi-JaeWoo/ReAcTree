Your task is to: clean up a container and jar and put them onto the table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up container, clean and pick up container, find and pick up jar, and place container and jar on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up container, clean and pick up container, find and pick up jar, place container and jar on table
