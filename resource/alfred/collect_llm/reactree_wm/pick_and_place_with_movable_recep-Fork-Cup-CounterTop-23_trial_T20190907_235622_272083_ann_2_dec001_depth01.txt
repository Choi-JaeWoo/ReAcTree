Your task is to: Put a fork in a glass to set up near the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding a fork, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, place fork in glass, and place glass on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, place fork in glass, place glass on counter
