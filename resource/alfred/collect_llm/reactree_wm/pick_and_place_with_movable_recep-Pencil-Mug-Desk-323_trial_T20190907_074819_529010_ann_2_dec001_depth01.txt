Your task is to: Put a cup with a pencil in it on the desk.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Desk (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, put pencil in cup, and place cup on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, put pencil in cup, place cup on desk
