Think: Since I’m not holding black spray bottle, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up black spray bottle, and place black spray bottle under right side of sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up black spray bottle, place black spray bottle under right side of sink
