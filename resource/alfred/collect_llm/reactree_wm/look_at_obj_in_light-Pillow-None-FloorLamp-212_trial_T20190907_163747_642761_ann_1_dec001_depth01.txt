Your task is to: Carry a cushion while turning on a lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding cushion, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cushion and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
