Your task is to: Put the soap container in the trash.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding soap container, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap container and place soap container in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
