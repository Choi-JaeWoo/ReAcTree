Your task is to: put the pencil in the cup, put it in the shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pencil, place pencil in cup, find and pick up cup, and place cup in shelf.
OK.
