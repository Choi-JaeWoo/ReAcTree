Your task is to: Put a cooked egg on the small black table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding egg, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, cook and pick up egg, and place egg on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, cook and pick up egg, place egg on table
