Your task is to: Place a slice of warmed bread on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bread, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bread, warm and pick up bread, and place bread on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bread, warm and pick up bread, place bread on table
