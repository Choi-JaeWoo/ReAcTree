Your task is to: Place a cleaned pear slice on a small table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a pear slice, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up pear, clean and pick up pear, and place pear on small table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up pear, clean and pick up pear, place pear on small table
