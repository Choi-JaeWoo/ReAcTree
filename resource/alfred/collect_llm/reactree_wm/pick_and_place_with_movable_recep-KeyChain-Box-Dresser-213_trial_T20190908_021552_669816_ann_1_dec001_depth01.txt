Your task is to: Moving the keys to a counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys and place keys on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on counter
