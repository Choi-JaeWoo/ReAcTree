Your task is to: Place a mug containing a pencil on the desk.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the mug, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, put pencil in mug, and place mug on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
