Your task is to: Move two statues from the coffee table to the dresser.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue, place statue on dresser, find and pick up statue, and place statue on dresser.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, place statue on dresser, find and pick up statue, and place statue on dresser
