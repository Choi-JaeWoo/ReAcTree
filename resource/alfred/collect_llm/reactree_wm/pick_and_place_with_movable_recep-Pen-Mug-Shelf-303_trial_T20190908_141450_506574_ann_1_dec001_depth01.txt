Your task is to: Move the coffee cup from the desk to the bookshelf. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the coffee cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up coffee cup, place coffee cup on bookshelf, and place coffee cup on desk.
OK.
