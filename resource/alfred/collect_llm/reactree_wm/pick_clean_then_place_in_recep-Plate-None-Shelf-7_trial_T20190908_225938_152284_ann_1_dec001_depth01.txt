Your task is to: Wash a dish in the sink to put it on the bookshelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a dish, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up dish, clean and pick up dish, find and pick up dish away from sink, and place dish on bookshelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up dish, clean and pick up dish, find and pick up dish away from sink, place dish on bookshelf
