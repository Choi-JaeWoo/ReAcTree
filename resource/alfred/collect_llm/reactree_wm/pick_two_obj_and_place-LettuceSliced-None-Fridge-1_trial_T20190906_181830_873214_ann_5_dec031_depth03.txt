Your primary goal is to: Put cut lettuce in the refrigerator.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up lettuce, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in fridge, and place lettuce in fridge.
Your task is to: place lettuce in fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: I’m not holding a slice of lettuce. I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in fridge, and place lettuce in fridge.
OK.
