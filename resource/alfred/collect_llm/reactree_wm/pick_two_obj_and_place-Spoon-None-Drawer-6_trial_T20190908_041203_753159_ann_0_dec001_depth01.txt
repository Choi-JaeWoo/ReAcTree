Your task is to: Place two spoons inside the drawer next to the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding a spoon, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, place spoon in drawer, find and pick up spoon away from drawer, and place spoon in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in drawer, find and pick up spoon away from drawer, place spoon in drawer
