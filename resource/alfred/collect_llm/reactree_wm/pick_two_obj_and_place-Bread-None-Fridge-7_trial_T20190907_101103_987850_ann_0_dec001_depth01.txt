Your task is to: Move two loaves of bread into the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a loaf of bread, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bread, place bread in fridge, and find and pick up bread away from fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bread, place bread in fridge, find and pick up bread away from fridge
