Your task is to: place a box with a yellow object inside on top of the dining table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, find and pick up yellow object, and place box with yellow object on dining table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, find and pick up yellow object, place box with yellow object on dining table
