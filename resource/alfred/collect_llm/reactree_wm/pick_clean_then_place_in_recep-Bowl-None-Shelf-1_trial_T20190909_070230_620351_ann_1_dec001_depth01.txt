Your task is to: Put the washed bowl on the wooden shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bowl, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, clean and pick up bowl, find and pick up bowl away from shelf, and place bowl on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, clean and pick up bowl, find and pick up bowl away from shelf, place bowl on shelf
