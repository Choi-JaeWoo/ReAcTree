Your task is to: Placing a ladle onto the counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding a ladle, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up ladle, and place ladle on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up ladle, place ladle on counter
