Your task is to: Placing a large pan with sliced cabbage in it on a white table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on table, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, and place cabbage on pan near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on table, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, place cabbage on pan near table
