Your task is to: Move pan to counter, move spatula to pan
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Move pan to counter and move spatula to pan.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: move pan to counter, move spatula to pan
