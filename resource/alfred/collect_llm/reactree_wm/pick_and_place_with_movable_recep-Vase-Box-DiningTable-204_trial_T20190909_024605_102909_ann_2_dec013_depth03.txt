Your primary goal is to: Put a vase in a box and move to a different table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up vase, place vase in box, and move box to table.
Your task is to: move box to table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box and place box on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on table
