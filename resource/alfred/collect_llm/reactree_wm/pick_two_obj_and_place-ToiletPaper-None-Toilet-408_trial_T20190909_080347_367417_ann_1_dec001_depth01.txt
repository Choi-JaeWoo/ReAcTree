Your task is to: put two rolls of toilet paper on the back of the toilet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding toilet paper, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet paper, place toilet paper on toilet, Find and pick up toilet paper away from toilet, and place toilet paper on toilet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up toilet paper, place toilet paper on toilet, Find and pick up toilet paper away from toilet, place toilet paper on toilet
