Your task is to: To cool a lettuce slice and place it on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, cool and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, cool and pick up lettuce, place lettuce on counter
