Your task is to: Put a glass with a knife in it on the table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass, place glass on table, find and pick up knife, and place knife on glass near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass, place glass on table, find and pick up knife, place knife on glass near table
