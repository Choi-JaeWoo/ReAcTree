Your task is to: Put a statue and a trophy on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2, 3).
Think: Since I’m not holding statue or trophy, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue, place statue on coffee table, find and pick up trophy, and place trophy on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, place statue on coffee table, find and pick up trophy, place trophy on coffee table
