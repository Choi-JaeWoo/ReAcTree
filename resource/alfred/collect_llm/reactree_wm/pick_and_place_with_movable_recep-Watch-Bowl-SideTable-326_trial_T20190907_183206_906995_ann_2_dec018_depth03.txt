Your task is to: place bowl on end table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place watch in bowl, and place bowl on end table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place watch in bowl, place bowl on end table
