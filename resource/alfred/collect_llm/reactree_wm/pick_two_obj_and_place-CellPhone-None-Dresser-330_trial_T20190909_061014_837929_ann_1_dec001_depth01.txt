Your task is to: put two phones on top of bureau
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the phone, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up phone, place phone on bureau, Find and pick up phone away from bureau, and place phone on bureau.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up phone, place phone on bureau, Find and pick up phone away from bureau, place phone on bureau
