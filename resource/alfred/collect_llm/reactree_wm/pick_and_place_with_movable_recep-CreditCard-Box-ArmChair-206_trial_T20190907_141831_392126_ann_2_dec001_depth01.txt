Your task is to: place a box down on the blue chair in the corner of the room with a credit card in it
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place credit card in box, and place box on blue chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place credit card in box, place box on blue chair
