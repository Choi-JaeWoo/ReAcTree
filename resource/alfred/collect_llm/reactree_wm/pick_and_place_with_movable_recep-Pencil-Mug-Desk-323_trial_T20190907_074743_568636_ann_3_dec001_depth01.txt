Your task is to: Place a mug with a pencil on a wooden desk.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Desk (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the mug, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, find and pick up pencil, and place mug and pencil on desk.
OK.
