Your task is to: Bring two set of keys to the coffee table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys and find and pick up keys.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys and find, find and pick up keys and find
