Your task is to: Put the washed soap bar in the trash bin
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding soap bar, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap bar, clean and pick up soap bar, and place soap bar in trash bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap bar, clean and pick up soap bar, place soap bar in trash bin
