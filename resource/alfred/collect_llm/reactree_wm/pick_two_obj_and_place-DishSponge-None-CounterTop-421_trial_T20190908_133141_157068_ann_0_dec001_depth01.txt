Your task is to: Move two sponges to opposite sides of one sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponges, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponges and place sponges on opposite sides of one sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponges, place sponges on opposite sides of one sink
