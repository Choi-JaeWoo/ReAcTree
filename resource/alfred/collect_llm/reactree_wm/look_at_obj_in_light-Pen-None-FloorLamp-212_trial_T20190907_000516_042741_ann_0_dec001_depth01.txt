Your task is to: Grab the pen from the table, turn on the floor lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding pen, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen and turn on floor lamp.
OK.
