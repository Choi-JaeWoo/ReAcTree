Your task is to: Wet a sponge from the toilet lid in the sink and return it.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge, wet and pick up sponge, and place sponge on toilet lid.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, wet and pick up sponge, place sponge on toilet lid
