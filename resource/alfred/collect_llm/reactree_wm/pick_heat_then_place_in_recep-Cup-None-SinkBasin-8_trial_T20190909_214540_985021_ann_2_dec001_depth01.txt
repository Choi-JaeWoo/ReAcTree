Your task is to: Put the warmed up vase in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
Think: Since I’m not holding vase, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up vase, heat and pick up vase, and place vase in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up vase, heat and pick up vase, place vase in sink
