Your task is to: Place the key inside a box to put on the leather chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the key, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up key, place key in box, and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
