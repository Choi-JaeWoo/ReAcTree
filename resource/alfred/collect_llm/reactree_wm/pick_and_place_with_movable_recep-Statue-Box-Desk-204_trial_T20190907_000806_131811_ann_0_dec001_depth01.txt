Your task is to: place a box with a statue in it on the computer desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on desk, and find and pick up statue.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on desk, find and pick up statue
