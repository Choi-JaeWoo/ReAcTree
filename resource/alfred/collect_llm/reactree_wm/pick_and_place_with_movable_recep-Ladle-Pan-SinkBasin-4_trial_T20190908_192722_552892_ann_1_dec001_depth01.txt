Your task is to: Move a ladle and pan to the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up ladle, place ladle in sink basin, find and pick up pan, and place pan in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up ladle, place ladle in sink basin, find and pick up pan, place pan in sink basin
