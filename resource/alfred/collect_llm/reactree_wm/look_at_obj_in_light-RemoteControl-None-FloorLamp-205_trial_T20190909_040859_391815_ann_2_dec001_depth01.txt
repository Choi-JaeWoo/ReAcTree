Your task is to: Examine a remote control by the dim natural light of a living room.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding remote control, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote control and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote control, find and turn on lamp
