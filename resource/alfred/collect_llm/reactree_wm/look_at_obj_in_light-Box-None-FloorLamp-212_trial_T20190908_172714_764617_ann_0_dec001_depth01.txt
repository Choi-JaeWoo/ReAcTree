Your task is to: Pick up a box and turn a lamp on.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, find and turn on lamp
