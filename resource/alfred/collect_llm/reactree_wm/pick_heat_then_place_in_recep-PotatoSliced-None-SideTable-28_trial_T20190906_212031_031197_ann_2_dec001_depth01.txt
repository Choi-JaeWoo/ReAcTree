Your task is to: Use knife to slice potato, cook potato in microwave, followed by placing on black table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, find and pick up black table, and place potato on black table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, find and pick up black table, place potato on black table
