Your task is to: Putting two bottles of soap in the trash can
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1, 2), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding two bottles of soap, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap, place soap in trash can, and find and pick up soap away from trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, place soap in trash can, find and pick up soap away from trash can
