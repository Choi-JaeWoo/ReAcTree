Your task is to: Put the white cup with spoon on the shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, find and pick up spoon, place cup on shelf, and place spoon on cup.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, find and pick up spoon, place cup on shelf, place spoon on cup
