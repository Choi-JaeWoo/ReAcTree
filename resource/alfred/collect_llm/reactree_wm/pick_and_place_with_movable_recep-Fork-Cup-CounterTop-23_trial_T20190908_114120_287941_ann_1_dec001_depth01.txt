Your task is to: Put a glass with a fork in it on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass, place glass on counter, find and pick up fork, and place fork in glass near counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass, place glass on counter, find and pick up fork, place fork in glass near counter
