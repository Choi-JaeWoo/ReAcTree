Your task is to: Place a cabbage slice in a pan and put in the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a cabbage slice, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, place cabbage in pan, place pan in fridge, and close fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, place cabbage in pan, place pan in fridge, close fridge
