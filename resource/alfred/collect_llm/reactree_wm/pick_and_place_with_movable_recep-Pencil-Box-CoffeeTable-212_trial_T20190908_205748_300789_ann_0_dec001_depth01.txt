Your task is to: Place a box with a pencil in it on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on table, and find and pick up pencil.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on table, find and pick up pencil
