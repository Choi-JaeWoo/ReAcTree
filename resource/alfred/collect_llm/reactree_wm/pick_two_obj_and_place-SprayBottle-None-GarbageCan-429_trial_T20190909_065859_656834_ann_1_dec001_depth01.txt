Your task is to: Put two bottles in a trash can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bottle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bottle, place bottle in trash can, find and pick up bottle away from trash can, and place bottle in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bottle, place bottle in trash can, find and pick up bottle away from trash can, place bottle in trash can
