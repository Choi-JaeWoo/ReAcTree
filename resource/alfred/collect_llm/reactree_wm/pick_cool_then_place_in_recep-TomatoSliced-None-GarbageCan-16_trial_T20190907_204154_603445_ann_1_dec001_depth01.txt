Your task is to: Place chilled tomato slice in silver bin
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of tomato, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, cool and pick up tomato, find and pick up silver bin, and place tomato in silver bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, cool and pick up tomato, find and pick up silver bin, place tomato in silver bin
