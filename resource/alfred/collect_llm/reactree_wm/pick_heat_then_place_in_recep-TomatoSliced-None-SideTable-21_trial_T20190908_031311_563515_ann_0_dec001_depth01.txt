Your task is to: place a cooked tomato  slice on the shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on shelf, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, and place tomato on plate near shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on shelf, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, and place tomato on plate near shelf
