Your task is to: move the pot to the counter by sink, put the apple in the pot
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding pot, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, move and pick up pot, and place apple in pot.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, move and pick up pot, place apple in pot
