Your task is to: Chill a drinking glass in the refrigerator and put it on the brown table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the glass, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass, cool and pick up glass, and place glass on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass, cool and pick up glass, place glass on table
