Your task is to: Move two black bats to the bed.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding black bat, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bat, place bat on bed, Find and pick up bat away from bed, and place bat on bed.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bat, place bat on bed, Find and pick up bat away from bed, place bat on bed
