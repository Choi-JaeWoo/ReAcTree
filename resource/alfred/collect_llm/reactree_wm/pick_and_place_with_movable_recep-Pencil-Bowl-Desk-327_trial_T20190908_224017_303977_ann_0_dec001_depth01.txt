Your task is to: Pu the cup with pencil on the desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, put pencil in cup, and place cup on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, put pencil in cup, place cup on desk
