Your task is to: Throw a warm piece of bread in the trash can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
Think: Since I’m not holding a piece of bread, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, heat and pick up bread, and place bread in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, heat and pick up bread, place bread in trash can
