Your task is to: Grab the toilet paper roll, set it inside the drawer, take the empty roll and put it inside the drawer
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet paper roll, place toilet paper roll in drawer, find and pick up empty roll, place empty roll in drawer, and close drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up toilet paper roll, place toilet paper roll in drawer, find and pick up empty roll, place empty roll in drawer, close drawer
