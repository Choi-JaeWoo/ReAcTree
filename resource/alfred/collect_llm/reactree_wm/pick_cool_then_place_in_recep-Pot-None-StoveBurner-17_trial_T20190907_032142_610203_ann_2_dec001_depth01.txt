Your task is to: Cool down one of the pots on the stove.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding pot, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, cool and pick up pot, and place pot on stove.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, cool and pick up pot, place pot on stove
