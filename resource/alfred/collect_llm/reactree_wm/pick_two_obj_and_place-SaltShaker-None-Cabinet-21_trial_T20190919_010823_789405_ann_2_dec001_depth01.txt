Your task is to: Move two shakers to a cabinet under sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding shakers, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up shakers, place shakers in cabinet, find and pick up shakers away from cabinet, and place shakers in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up shakers, place shakers in cabinet, find and pick up shakers away from cabinet, place shakers in cabinet
