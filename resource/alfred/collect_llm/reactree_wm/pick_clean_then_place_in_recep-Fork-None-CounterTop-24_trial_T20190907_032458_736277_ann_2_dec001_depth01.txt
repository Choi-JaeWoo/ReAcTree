Your task is to: Rinse off a spoon, placing it onto the counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
Think: Since I’m not holding a spoon, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, clean and pick up spoon, and place spoon on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, clean and pick up spoon, place spoon on counter
