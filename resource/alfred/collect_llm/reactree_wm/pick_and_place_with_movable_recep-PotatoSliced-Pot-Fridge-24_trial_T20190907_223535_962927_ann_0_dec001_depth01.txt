Your task is to: To put a knife plus a potato slice in a pan and put the pan in the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, place knife in pan, find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, and place potato in pan near fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, place knife in pan, find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, and place potato in pan near fridge
