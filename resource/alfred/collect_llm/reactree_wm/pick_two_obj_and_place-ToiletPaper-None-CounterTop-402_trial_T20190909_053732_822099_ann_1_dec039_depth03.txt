Your primary goal is to: Move two toilet paper rolls to the counter.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up toilet paper, place toilet paper on counter, find and pick up toilet paper away from counter, and place toilet paper on counter.
Your task is to: place toilet paper on counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), Shelf (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding toilet paper, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet paper, and place toilet paper on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up toilet paper, place toilet paper on counter
