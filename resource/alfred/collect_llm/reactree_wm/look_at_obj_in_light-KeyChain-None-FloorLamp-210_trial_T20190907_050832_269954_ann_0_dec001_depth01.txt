Your task is to: Grab the key chain from the sofa, turn on the floor lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding key chain, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up key chain and turn on floor lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up key chain, turn on floor lamp
