Your task is to: Place the two CDs on the dresser into the drawer.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the CD, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up CD, place CD in drawer, Find and pick up CD away from drawer, and place CD in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
