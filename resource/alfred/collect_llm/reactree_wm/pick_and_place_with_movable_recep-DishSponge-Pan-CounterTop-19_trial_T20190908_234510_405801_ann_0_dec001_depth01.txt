Your task is to: Put the pan with sponge on the right side of the sink counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding pan, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on countertop, find and pick up sponge, and place sponge on pan near countertop.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on countertop, find and pick up sponge, place sponge on pan near countertop
