Your task is to: Pick up the remote controller and turn off the lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding remote controller, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote controller and turn off lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote controller, turn off lamp
