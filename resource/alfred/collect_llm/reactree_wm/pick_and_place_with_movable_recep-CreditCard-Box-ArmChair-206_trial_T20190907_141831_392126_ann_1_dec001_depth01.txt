Your task is to: Put a credit card in a box onto the chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the credit card, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up credit card, place credit card in box, and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up credit card, place credit card in box, place box on chair
