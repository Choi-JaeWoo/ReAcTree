Your task is to: Put two statues on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2, 3).
Think: Since I’m not holding statues, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue, place statue on coffee table, and find and pick up statue.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, place statue on coffee table, find and pick up statue
