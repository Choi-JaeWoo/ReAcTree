Your task is to: Move the kleenex box to the coffee table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding kleenex box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up kleenex box and place kleenex box on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up kleenex box, place kleenex box on coffee table
