Your task is to: To place two rags that are black and white onto two shelves.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding black rag, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up black rag, place black rag on shelf, and find and pick up white rag.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up black rag, place black rag on shelf, find and pick up white rag
