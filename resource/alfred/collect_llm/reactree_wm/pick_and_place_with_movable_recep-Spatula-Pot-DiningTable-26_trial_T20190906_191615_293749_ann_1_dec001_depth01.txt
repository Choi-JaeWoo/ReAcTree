Your task is to: Put a pot with a spatula on the table next to the stove. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot on table, find and pick up spatula, and place spatula on pot near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot on table, find and pick up spatula, place spatula on pot near table
