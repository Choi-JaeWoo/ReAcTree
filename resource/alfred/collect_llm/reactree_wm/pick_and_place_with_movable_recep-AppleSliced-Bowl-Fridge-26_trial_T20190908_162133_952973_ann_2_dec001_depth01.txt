Your task is to: Put a bowl containing a piece of apple in the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bowl containing a piece of apple, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, put apple in bowl, and place bowl in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, put apple in bowl, place bowl in fridge
