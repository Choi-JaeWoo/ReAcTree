Your task is to: turn on a lamp in the corner of the room while holding a credit card
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), Cabinet (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the lamp, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and turn on lamp and find and pick up credit card.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and turn on lamp, find and pick up credit card
