Your task is to: Move a remote and box to the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on table, Find and pick up box, and place box on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on table, Find and pick up box, place box on table
