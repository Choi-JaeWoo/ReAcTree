Your task is to: put a clean cloth on top of the toilet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding cloth, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cloth, clean and pick up cloth, and place cloth on toilet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cloth, clean and pick up cloth, place cloth on toilet
