Your task is to: Put two bars of soap in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap, place soap in sink basin, find and pick up soap, and place soap in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, place soap in sink basin, find and pick up soap, place soap in sink basin
