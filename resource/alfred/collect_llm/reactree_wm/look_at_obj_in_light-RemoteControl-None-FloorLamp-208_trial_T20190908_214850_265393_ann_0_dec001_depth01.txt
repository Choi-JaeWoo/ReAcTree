Your task is to: Examine a remote by the light of the tall lamp. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding remote, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
