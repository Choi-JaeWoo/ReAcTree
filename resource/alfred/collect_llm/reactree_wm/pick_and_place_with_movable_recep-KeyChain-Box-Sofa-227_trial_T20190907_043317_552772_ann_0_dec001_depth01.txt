Your task is to: Put keys inside a box and move it to the couch.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, find and pick up box, place keys in box, and place box on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, find and pick up box, place keys in box, place box on couch
