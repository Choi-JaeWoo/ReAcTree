Your task is to: Place a statue on a end table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding statue, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue and place statue on end table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, place statue on end table
