Your task is to: Put a metal pot with a sponge in it on a round white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27).
Think: Since I’m not holding pot, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot on table, and place sponge in pot.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot on table, place sponge in pot
