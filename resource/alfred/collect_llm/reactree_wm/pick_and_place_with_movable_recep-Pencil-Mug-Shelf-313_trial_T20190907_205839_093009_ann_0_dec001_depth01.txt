Your task is to: Put a cup with a pencil on a shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup on shelf, find and pick up pencil, and place pencil on cup near shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
