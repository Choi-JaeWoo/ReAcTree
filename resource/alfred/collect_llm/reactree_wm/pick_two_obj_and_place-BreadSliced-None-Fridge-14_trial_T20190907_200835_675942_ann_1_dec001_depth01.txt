Your task is to: cut a loaf of bread and place one slice in the refrigerator
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, and place bread in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, place bread in fridge
