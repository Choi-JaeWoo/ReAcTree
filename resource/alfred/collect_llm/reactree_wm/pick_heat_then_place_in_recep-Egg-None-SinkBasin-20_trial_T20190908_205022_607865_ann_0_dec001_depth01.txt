Your task is to: Place a cooked egg in a sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, cook and pick up egg, find and pick up pan, and place egg in pan near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, cook and pick up egg, find and pick up pan, place egg in pan near sink basin
