Your task is to: carry the remote to the lamp, turn on the lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, carry remote to lamp, and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, carry remote to lamp, turn on lamp
