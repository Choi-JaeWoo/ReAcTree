Your task is to: Put a remote in a box and return the remote to its original place.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote in box, return remote to original place, and place remote on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote in box, return remote to original place, and place remote on couch.
