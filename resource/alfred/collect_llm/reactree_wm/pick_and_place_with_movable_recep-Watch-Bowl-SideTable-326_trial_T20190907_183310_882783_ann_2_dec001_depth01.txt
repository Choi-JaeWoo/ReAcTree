Your task is to: Put a bowl with a watch on the end table in between the two beds.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bowl, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, find and pick up watch, place bowl on end table, and place watch on bowl.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, find and pick up watch, place bowl on end table, place watch on bowl
