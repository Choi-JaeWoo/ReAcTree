Your task is to: Place the two candles into the bottom drawer below the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the candle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up candle, place candle in drawer, find and pick up candle away from drawer, and place candle in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up candle, place candle in drawer, find and pick up candle away from drawer, place candle in drawer
