Your task is to: Place a remote control into a box, move the box to a certain chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote control, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote control, place remote control into box, move box to chair, and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote control, place remote control into box, move box to chair, place box on chair
