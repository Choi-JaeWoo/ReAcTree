Your task is to: Put a fork into a white mug to put into the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Safe (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Think: Since I’m not holding fork, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, place fork in mug, and place mug in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, place fork in mug, place mug in sink basin
