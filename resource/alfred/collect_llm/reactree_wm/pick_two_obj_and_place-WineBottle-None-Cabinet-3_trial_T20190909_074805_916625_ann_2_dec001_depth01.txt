Your task is to: Put two green bottles in the cabinet directly below the loaf of bread on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a green bottle, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up green bottle, place green bottle in cabinet, find and pick up green bottle away from cabinet, place green bottle in cabinet, and find and pick up green bottle away from cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up green bottle, place green bottle in cabinet, find and pick up green bottle away from cabinet, place green bottle in cabinet, find and pick up green bottle away from cabinet
