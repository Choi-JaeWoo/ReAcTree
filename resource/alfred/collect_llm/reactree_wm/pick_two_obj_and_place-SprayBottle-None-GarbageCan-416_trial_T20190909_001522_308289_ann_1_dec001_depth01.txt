Your task is to: Put two spray bottles in the garbage can. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding spray bottle, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spray bottle, place spray bottle in garbage can, and find and pick up spray bottle away from garbage can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
