Your task is to: Put a plate with a watch on it on a black table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on black table, and find and pick up watch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on black table, find and pick up watch
