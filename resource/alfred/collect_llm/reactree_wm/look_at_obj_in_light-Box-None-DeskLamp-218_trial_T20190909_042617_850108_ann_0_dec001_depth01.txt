Your task is to: Look at a box under the light of a lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
