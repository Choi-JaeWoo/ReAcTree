Your task is to: place white plate with green sponge in cabinet under sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding white plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up white plate, find and pick up green sponge, and place white plate with green sponge in cabinet under sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up white plate, find and pick up green sponge, place white plate with green sponge in cabinet under sink
