Your task is to: Move the keys from the table to the sofa
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeTable (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys and place keys on sofa.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
