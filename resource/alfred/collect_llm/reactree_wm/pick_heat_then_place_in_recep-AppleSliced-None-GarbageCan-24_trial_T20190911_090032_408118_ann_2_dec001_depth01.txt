Your task is to: Put the cooked apple slice in the trash.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple slice, heat and pick up apple slice, and place apple slice in trash.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple slice, heat and pick up apple slice, place apple slice in trash
