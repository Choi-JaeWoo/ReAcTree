Your task is to: Move a bowl and pen to a small table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding bowl and pen, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl on small table, find and pick up pen, and place pen on small table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl on small table, find and pick up pen, and place pen on small table
