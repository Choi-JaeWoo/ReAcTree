Your task is to: Place chilled orange cup with spoon on counter between kettle and tomato
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, cool and pick up cup, find and pick up spoon, place spoon on cup, and place cup on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, cool and pick up cup, find and pick up spoon, place spoon on cup, place cup on counter
