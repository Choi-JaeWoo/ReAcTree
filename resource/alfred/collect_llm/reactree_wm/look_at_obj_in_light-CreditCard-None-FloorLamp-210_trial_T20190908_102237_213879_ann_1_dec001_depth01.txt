Your task is to: Inspect a card with a lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding card, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up card and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up card, find and turn on lamp
