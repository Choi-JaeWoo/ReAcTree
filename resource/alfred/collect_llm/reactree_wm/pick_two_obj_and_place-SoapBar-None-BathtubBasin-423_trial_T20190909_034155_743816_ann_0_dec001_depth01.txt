Your task is to: Put two soaps in the bath
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding soap, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap, place soap in bath, Find and pick up soap away from bath, and place soap in bath.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, place soap in bath, Find and pick up soap away from bath, place soap in bath
