Your task is to: Carry the tea pot white turning on a lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the tea pot, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tea pot and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tea pot, find and turn on lamp
