Your task is to: Put a box containing a cell phone onto the black desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, open and pick up cell phone, and place cell phone on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, open and pick up cell phone, place cell phone on desk
