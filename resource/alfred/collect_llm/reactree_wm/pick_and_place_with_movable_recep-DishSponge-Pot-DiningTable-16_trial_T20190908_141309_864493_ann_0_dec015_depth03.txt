Your primary goal is to: Put a metal pot with a sponge in it on a round white table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up pot, place pot on table, and place sponge in pot.
Your task is to: place sponge in pot
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge and place sponge in pot.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge in pot
