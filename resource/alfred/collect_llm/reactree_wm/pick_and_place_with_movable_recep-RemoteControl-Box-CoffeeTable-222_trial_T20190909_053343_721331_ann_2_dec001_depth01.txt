Your task is to: put box and remote onto coffee table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on coffee table, find and pick up remote, and place remote on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on coffee table, find and pick up remote, place remote on coffee table
