Your task is to: Place a mug and fork in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug in sink basin, find and pick up fork, and place fork in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug in sink basin, find and pick up fork, place fork in sink basin
