Your task is to: Place bats on a bed
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bat, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bat and place bat on bed.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bat, place bat on bed
