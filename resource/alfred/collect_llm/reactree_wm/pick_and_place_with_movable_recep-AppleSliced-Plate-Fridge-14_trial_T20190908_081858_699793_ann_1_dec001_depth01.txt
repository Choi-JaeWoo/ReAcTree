Your task is to: Put the plate with apple in the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate in fridge, and place apple on plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate in fridge, place apple on plate
