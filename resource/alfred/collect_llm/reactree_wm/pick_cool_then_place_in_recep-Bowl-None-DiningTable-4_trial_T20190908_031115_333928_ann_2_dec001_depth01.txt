Your task is to: Put a chilled fork and bowl on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the fork and bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, cool and pick up fork, and place fork on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, cool and pick up fork, place fork on table
