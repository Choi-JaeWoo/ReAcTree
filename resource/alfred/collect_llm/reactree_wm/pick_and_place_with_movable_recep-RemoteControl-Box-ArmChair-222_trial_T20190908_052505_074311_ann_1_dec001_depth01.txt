Your task is to: Put a remote into a box, take the box to the chair
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote in box, and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote in box, place box on chair
