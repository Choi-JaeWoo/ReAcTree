Your task is to: place two black statues on top of the dining room table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the statue, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue, place statue on dining room table, Find and pick up statue away from dining room table, and place statue on dining room table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, place statue on dining room table, Find and pick up statue away from dining room table, place statue on dining room table
