Your task is to: take the statue from the desk to the coffee table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the statue, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue, move and pick up statue, and place statue on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, move and pick up statue, place statue on coffee table
