Your task is to: Put a pen on a plate and put it on the coffee table's middle shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding pen, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, place pen on plate, find and pick up plate, and place plate on coffee table's middle shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pen, place pen on plate, find and pick up plate, place plate on coffee table's middle shelf
