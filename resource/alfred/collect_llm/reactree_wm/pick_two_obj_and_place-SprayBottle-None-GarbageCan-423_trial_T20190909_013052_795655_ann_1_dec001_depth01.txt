Your task is to: Put two spray bottles in the trash.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the spray bottle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spray bottle, place spray bottle in trash can, Find and pick up spray bottle away from trash can, and place spray bottle in trash can.
OK.
