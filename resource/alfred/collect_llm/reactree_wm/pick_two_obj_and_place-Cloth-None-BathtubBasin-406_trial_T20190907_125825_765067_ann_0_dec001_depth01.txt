Your task is to: put two cloth in the tub
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).

OK.
Expand:
