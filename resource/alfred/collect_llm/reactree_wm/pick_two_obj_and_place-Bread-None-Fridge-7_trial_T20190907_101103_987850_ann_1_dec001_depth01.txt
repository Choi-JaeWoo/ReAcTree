Your task is to: Move two loaves of bread from the table to the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding any bread, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up two loaves of bread, move and pick up two loaves of bread, and place two loaves of bread in the refrigerator.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up two loaves of bread, move and pick up two loaves of bread, place two loaves of bread in the refrigerator
