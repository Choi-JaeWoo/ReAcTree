Your task is to: Put a bowl with a watch in it on the shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place watch in bowl, and place bowl on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place watch in bowl, place bowl on shelf
