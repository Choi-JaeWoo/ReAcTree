Your task is to: Put two candlesticks away below the rightmost sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), Shelf (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding candlesticks, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up candlesticks, place candlesticks in sink basin, and place candlesticks in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up candlesticks, place candlesticks in sink basin, place candlesticks in cabinet
