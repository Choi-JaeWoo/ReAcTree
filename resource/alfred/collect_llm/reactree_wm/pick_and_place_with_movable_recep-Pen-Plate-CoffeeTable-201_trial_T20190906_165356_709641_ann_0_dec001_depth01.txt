Your task is to: Gather a pen and plate and put them on a table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, place pen on table, find and pick up plate, and place plate on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pen, place pen on table, find and pick up plate, place plate on table
