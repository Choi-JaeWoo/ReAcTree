Your task is to: Moving blue pens from a desk to another location 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding blue pens, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up blue pens and place blue pens on another location.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up blue pens, place blue pens on another location
