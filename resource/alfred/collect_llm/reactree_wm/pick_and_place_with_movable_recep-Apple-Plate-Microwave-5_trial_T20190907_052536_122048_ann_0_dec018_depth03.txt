Your primary goal is to: Put the apple on a plate and put it in the microwave.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up apple, put apple on plate, and put apple in microwave.
Your task is to: put apple in microwave
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, put apple on plate, and put apple in microwave.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, put apple on plate, put apple in microwave
