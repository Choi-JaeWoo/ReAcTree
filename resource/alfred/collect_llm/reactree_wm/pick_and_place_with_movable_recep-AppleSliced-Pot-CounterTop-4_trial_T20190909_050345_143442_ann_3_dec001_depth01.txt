Your task is to: Put a metal pot with a piece of sliced apple in it onto the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot on countertop, find and pick up knife, and slice and pick up apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot on countertop, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple
