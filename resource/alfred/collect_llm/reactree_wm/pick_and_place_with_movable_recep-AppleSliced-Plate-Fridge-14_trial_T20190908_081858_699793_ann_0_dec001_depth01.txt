Your task is to: Put a plate with an apple slice on it into the fridge. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding a plate, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, and place apple on plate near fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, place apple on plate near fridge
