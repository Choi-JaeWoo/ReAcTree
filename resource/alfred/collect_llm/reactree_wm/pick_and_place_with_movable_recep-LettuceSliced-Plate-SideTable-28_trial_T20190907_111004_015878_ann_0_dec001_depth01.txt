Your task is to: Put a gray plate with a slice of lettuce on it on a stand.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of lettuce, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, clean and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce on plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, clean and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce on plate
