Your task is to: Slice the apple, put an apple slice, knife in the plate, put plate in the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, place apple slice, knife in the plate, and put plate in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, place apple slice, knife in the plate, put plate in the fridge
