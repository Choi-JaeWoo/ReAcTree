Your task is to: Put a remote control in a box on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote control, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote control, place remote control in box, Find and pick up remote control away from box, and place remote control in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote control, place remote control in box, Find and pick up remote control away from box, and place remote control in box
