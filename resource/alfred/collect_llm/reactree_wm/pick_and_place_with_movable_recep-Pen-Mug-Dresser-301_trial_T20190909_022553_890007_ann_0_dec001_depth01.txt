Your task is to: Place a mug with a pen on a dresser.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding mug, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug on dresser, and place pen on mug.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug on dresser, place pen on mug
