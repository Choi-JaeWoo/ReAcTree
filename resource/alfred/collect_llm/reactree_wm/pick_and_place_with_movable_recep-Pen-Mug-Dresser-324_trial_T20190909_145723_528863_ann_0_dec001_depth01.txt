Your task is to: Put a pen in a mug on the dresser. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding pen, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, find and pick up mug, and place pen in mug.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pen, find and pick up mug, place pen in mug
