Your task is to: Put a bowl with a phone inside on a end table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl in end table, find and pick up phone, and place phone in bowl near end table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
