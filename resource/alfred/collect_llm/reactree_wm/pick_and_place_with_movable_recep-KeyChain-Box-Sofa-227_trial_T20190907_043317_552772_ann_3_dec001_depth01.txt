Your task is to: Get keys from coffee table, put them in the box on the table and place box on sofa.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys in box, place box on table, and place box on sofa.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys in box, place box on table, place box on sofa
