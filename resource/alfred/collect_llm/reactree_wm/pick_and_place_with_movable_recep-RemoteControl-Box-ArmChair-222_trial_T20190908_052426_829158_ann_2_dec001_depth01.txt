Your task is to: drop a carton with a remote in it on the chair
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the carton, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up carton and place carton on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up carton, place carton on chair
