Your task is to: move two glass bottles to the shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding glass bottles, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass bottles and place glass bottles on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass bottles, place glass bottles on shelf
