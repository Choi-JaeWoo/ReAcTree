Your task is to: Place a mug with a spoon in it in the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug in sink basin, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon in mug near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug in sink basin, find and pick up spoon, place spoon in mug near sink basin
