Your task is to: Move a bar of soap from a tub to a toilet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding bar of soap, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap and place soap on toilet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, place soap on toilet
