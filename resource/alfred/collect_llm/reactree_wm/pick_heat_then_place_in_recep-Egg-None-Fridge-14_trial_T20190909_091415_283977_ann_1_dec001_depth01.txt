Your task is to: Put a warm egg in the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding the egg, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, heat and pick up egg, and place egg in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, heat and pick up egg, place egg in fridge
