Your task is to: Inspect a gold disk with the light on the desk next to the bed.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding gold disk, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up gold disk and find and turn on lamp.
OK.

- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up gold disk, find and turn on lamp
