Your task is to: To gather two cups and put them in the microwave.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding cups, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cups, heat and pick up cups, and place cups in microwave.
OK.
Expand:
