Your task is to: place a microwaved apple slice inside of the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding a microwaved apple slice, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, find and pick up apple slice, and place apple slice in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, find and pick up apple slice, place apple slice in fridge
