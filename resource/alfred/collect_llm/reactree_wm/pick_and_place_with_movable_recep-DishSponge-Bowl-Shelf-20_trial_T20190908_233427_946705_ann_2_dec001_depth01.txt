Your task is to: Place a bowl with a sponge inside on the shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl in shelf, find and pick up sponge, and place sponge in bowl near shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl in shelf, find and pick up sponge, place sponge in bowl near shelf
