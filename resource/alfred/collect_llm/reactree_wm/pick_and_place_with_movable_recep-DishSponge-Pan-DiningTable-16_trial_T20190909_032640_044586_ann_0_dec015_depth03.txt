Your primary goal is to: Take sponge from counter, place on pan on stove, pick both up, move to table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up sponge, place sponge on pan, and place sponge on table.
Your task is to: place sponge on table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge and place sponge on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge on table
