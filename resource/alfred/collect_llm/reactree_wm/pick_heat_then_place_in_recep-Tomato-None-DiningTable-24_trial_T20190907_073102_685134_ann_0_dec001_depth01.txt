Your task is to: Put a heated tomato on the table in front of the coffee machine. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
Think: Since I’m not holding tomato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, and place tomato on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, place tomato on table
