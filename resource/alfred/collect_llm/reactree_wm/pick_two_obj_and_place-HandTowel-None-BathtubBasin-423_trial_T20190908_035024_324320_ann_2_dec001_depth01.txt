You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the towel, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up towel, place towel in bathtub, Find and pick up towel away from bathtub, and place towel in bathtub.
OK.
Expand:
