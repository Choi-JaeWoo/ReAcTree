Your task is to: Place box with credit card on counter with monitor
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding a box with credit card, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, find and pick up credit card, and place box with credit card on counter with monitor.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, find and pick up credit card, place box with credit card on counter with monitor
