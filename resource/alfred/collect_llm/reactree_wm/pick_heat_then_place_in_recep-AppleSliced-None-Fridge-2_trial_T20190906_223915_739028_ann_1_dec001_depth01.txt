Your task is to: Place a warmed apple slice into the refrigerator. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding a warmed apple slice, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, find and pick up apple slice, and place apple slice in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, heat and pick up apple, find and pick up apple slice, place apple slice in fridge
