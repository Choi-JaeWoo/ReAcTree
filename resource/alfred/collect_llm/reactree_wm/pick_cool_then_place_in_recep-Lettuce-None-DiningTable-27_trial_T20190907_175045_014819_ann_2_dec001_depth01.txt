Your task is to: Put chilled lettuce on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding the lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce on table, and find and pick up lettuce away from table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce on table, and find and pick up lettuce away from table
