Your task is to: Move an empty brown toilet paper roll to the plunger by the toilet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding toilet paper roll, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet paper roll and place toilet paper roll on plunger.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up toilet paper roll, place toilet paper roll on plunger
