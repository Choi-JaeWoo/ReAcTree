Your task is to: Move a plate and candle stick to a shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2, 3).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate and candle stick, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, find and pick up candle stick, place plate on shelf, and place candle stick on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, find and pick up candle stick, place plate on shelf, place candle stick on shelf
