Your task is to: Place two set of keys on a desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on desk, Find and pick up keys away from desk, and place keys on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on desk, Find and pick up keys away from desk, place keys on desk
