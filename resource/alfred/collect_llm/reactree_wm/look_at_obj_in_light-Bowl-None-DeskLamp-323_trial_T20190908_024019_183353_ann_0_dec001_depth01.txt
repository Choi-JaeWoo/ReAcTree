Your task is to: turn on the bed lamp while holding the plate
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Desk (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate and find and turn on bed lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, find and turn on bed lamp
