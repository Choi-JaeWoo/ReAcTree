Your task is to: Putting a bowl with a sliced potato in it in the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, and place potato on bowl near fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, and place potato on bowl near fridge
