Your task is to: Chill a potato in the refrigerator, prepare cook it in the microwave.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
Think: Since I’m not holding the potato, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, and place potato on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, place potato on counter
