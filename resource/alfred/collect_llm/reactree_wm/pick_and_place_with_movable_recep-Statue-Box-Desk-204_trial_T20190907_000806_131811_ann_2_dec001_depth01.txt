Your task is to: Move the horse statue into the box, move the box to the black table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the horse statue, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up horse statue and place horse statue in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up horse statue, place horse statue in box
