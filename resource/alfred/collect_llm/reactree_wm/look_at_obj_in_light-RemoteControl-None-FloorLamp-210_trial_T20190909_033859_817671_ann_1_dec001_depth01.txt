Your task is to: Examine a remote in the light of a tall lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding remote, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, find and turn on lamp
