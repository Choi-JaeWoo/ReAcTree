Your task is to: Put a glass with a metal fork inside of it on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding a glass, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass, place fork in glass, and place glass on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass, place fork in glass, place glass on counter
