Your task is to: turn a lamp off while holding a trophy 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding a trophy, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up trophy and find and turn off lamp.
OK.
