Your task is to: Put a chilled plate on the middle shelf in the corner.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, cool and pick up plate, and place plate on middle shelf in corner.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, cool and pick up plate, place plate on middle shelf in corner
