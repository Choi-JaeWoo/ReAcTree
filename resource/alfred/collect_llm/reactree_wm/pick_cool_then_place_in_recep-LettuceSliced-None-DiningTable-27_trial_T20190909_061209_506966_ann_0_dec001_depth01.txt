Your task is to: To cool a slice of lettuce and place it on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, cool and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, cool and pick up lettuce, place lettuce on table
