Your task is to: Place a tube and a toilet paper roll in the left drawer below the sink next to the bathtub.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 6 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tube, place tube in drawer, find and pick up toilet paper roll, place toilet paper roll in drawer, find and pick up tube away from drawer, and place tube in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tube, place tube in drawer, find and pick up toilet paper roll, place toilet paper roll in drawer, find and pick up tube away from drawer, place tube in drawer
