Your task is to: take bottle off of counter, place in trash can, take bottle off of back of toilet, put in trash can 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding bottle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bottle, place bottle in trash can, find and pick up bottle, and place bottle in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bottle, place bottle in trash can, find and pick up bottle, place bottle in trash can
