Your task is to: Place a pot with a piece of lettuce in it on the white table next to the trash bag.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a pot with a piece of lettuce in it, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, find and pick up lettuce, put lettuce in pot, and place pot on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, find and pick up lettuce, put lettuce in pot, and place pot on table
