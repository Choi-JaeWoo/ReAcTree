Your task is to: Put a knife in bowl on the end table in front of the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, find and pick up bowl, and place knife in bowl.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, find and pick up bowl, place knife in bowl
