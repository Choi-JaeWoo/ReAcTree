Your task is to: To chill a loaf of bread and put it on the counter. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bread, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, and place bread on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, place bread on counter
