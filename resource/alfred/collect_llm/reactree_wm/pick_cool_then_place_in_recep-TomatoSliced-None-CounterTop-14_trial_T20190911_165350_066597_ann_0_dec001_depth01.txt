Your task is to: Place a cooled slice of tomato in front of the coffee maker
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of tomato, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, cool and pick up tomato, and place tomato near coffee maker.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, cool and pick up tomato, place tomato near coffee maker
