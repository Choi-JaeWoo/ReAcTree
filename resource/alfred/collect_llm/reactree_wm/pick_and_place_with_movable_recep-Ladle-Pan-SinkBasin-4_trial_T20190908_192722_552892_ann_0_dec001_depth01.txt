Your task is to: Stand a spoon up in a pan and place in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding spoon, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, place spoon in pan, and place pan in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in pan, place pan in sink
