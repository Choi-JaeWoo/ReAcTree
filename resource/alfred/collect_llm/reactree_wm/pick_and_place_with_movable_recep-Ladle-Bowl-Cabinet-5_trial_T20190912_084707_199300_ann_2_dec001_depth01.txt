Your task is to: Place a glass bowl with a spoon in it into an upper kitchen cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding a glass bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass bowl, find and pick up spoon, and place glass bowl with spoon in it into an upper kitchen cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass bowl, find and pick up spoon, place glass bowl with spoon in it into an upper kitchen cabinet
