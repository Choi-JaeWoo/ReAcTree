Your task is to: Place a chilled potato slice in front of the toaster.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, place potato in front of toaster, and place potato on toaster.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up potato, place potato in front of toaster, place potato on toaster
