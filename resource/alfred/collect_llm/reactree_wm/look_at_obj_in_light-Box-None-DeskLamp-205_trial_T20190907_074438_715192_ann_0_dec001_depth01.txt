Your task is to: Grab the box from the sofa, turn on the lamp on the table by the window
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, turn on lamp
