Your task is to: Place a cup with a pencil in it on a book case shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup on book case shelf, and place pencil in cup.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place cup on book case shelf, place pencil in cup
