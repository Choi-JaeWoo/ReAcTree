Your task is to: Move both remotes to the sofa seat.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on couch, Find and pick up remote away from couch, and place remote on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on couch, Find and pick up remote away from couch, place remote on couch
