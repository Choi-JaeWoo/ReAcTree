Your task is to: Put a heated sweet potato into a blue bin.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding sweet potato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sweet potato, heat and pick up sweet potato, and place sweet potato in blue bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sweet potato, heat and pick up sweet potato, place sweet potato in blue bin
