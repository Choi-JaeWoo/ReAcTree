Your task is to: put a pot with an apple and a knife in the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot in sink basin, find and pick up apple, and place apple in pot near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot in sink basin, find and pick up apple, place apple in pot near sink basin
