Your task is to: Wash and move lettuce to a green bin. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, clean and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce in green bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, clean and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in green bin
