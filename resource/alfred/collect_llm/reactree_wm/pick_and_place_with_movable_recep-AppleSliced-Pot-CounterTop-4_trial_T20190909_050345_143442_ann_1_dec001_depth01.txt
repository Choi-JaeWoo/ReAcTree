Your task is to: To put a piece of apple in the pot on the stove and set the pot on the counter to the right of the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, find and pick up pot, place apple in pot, and place pot on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, find and pick up pot, place apple in pot, place pot on counter
