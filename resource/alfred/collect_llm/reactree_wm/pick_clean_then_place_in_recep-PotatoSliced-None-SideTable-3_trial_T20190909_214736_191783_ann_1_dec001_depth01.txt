Your task is to: Moving a sliced potato to the black table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding potato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, and place potato on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, place potato on table
