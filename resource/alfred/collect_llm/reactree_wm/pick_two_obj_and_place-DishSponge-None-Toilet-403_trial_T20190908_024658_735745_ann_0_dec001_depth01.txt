Your task is to: Place sponge one and two on the toilet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), Shelf (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge one, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge one, place sponge one on toilet, Find and pick up sponge two, and place sponge two on toilet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge one, place sponge one on toilet, Find and pick up sponge two, place sponge two on toilet
