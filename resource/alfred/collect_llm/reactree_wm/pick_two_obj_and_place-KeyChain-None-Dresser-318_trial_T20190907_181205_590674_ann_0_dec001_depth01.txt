Your task is to: Put two sets of keys on a table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on table, find and pick up keys away from table, and place keys on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on table, find and pick up keys away from table, place keys on table
