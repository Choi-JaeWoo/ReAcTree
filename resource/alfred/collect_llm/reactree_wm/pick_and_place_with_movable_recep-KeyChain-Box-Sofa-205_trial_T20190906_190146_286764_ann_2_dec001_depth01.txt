Your task is to: Place a box with keys in it on the couch. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, find and pick up keys, and place box on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, find and pick up keys, place box on couch
