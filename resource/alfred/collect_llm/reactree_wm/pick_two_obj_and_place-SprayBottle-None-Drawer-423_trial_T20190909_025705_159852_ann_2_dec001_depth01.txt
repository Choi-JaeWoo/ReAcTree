Your task is to: place two spray bottles inside of the bathroom sink cabinet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1, 2), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding spray bottle, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spray bottle, place spray bottle in cabinet, and find and pick up spray bottle away from cabinet.
OK.
