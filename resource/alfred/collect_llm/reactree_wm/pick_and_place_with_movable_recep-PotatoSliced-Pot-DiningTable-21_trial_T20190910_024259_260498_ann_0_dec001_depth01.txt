Your task is to: Place a pot with an apple slice in it by the toaster.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot in sink basin, find and pick up apple slice, and place apple slice in pot near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot in sink basin, find and pick up apple slice, place apple slice in pot near sink basin
