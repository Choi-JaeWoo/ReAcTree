Your task is to: Put a skillet with a potato and butter knife in it into the freezer. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up skillet, place skillet in freezer, find and pick up potato, and place potato in skillet near freezer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up skillet, place skillet in freezer, find and pick up potato, place potato in skillet near freezer
