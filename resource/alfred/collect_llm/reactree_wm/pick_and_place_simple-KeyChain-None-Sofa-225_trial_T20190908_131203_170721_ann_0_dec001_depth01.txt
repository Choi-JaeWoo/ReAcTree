Your task is to: Place a set of keys on a couch.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys and place keys on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
