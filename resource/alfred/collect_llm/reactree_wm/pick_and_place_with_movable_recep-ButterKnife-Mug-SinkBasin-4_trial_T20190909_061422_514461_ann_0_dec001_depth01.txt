Your task is to: clean up a knife and a mug then put them into the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, clean and pick up knife, find and pick up mug, and place knife and mug in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, clean and pick up knife, find and pick up mug, place knife and mug in sink basin
