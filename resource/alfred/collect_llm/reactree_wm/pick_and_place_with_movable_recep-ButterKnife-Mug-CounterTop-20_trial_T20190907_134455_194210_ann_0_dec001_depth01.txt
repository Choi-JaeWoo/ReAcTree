Your task is to: Place a white cup with a knife in it on the counter in front of the toaster.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup in front of toaster, find and pick up knife, and place knife in cup near toaster.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place cup in front of toaster, find and pick up knife, place knife in cup near toaster
