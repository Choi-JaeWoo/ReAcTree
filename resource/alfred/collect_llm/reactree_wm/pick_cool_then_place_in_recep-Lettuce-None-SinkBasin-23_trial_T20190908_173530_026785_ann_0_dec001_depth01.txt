Your task is to: To chill a head of lettuce and put it in the sink. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, chill and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, chill and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in sink
