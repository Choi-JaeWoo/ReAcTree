Your task is to: Place two CDs in safe
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Safe (1), LaundryHamper (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a CD, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up CD, place CD in safe, find and pick up CD away from safe, place CD in safe, and close safe.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up CD, place CD in safe, find and pick up CD away from safe, place CD in safe, close safe
