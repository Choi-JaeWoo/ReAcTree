Your task is to: Pan an apple in a pan in the fridge. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, pan and pick up apple, and place apple in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, pan and pick up apple, place apple in fridge
