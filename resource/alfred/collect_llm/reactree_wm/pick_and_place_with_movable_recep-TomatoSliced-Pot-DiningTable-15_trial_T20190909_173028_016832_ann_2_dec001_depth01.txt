Your task is to: place pan with tomato slice on white table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on table, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, and place tomato on pan near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on table, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, place tomato on pan near table
