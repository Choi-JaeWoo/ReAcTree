Your task is to: place a potato slice in front of the microwave
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a potato slice, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in microwave, find and pick up potato away from microwave, and place potato in front of microwave.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in microwave, find and pick up potato away from microwave, place potato in front of microwave
