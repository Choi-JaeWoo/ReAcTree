Your task is to: Put a clean pan in the kitchen cabinet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding pan, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, clean and pick up pan, and place pan in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, clean and pick up pan, place pan in cabinet
