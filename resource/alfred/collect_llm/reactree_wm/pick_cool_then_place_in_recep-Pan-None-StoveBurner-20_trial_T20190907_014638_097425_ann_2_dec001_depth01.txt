Your task is to: put the cooled off sauce pan back on the stove
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding the sauce pan, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sauce pan, cool and pick up sauce pan, and place sauce pan on stove.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sauce pan, cool and pick up sauce pan, place sauce pan on stove
