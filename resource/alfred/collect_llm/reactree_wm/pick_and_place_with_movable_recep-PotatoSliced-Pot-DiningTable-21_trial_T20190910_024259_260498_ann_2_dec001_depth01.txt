Your task is to: place a pan with a potato slice in it down on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on table, find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, and place potato on pan near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on table, find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, place potato on pan near table
