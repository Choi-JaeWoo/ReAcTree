Your task is to: Pick up knife and cup from table, move to sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, and find and pick up cup.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, and find and pick up cup
