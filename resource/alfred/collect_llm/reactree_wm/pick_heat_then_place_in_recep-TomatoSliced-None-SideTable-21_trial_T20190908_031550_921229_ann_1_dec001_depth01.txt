Your task is to: Put a piece of cooked apple on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a piece of cooked apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, cook and pick up apple, and place apple on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, cook and pick up apple, place apple on table
