Your task is to: Put away the spare remote onto the coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on coffee table, Find and pick up remote away from coffee table, and place remote on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on coffee table, Find and pick up remote away from coffee table, and place remote on coffee table
