Your task is to: place a cup with a pen in it down on the cabinet inbetween the walls
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup on cabinet, find and pick up pen, and place pen on cup near cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place cup on cabinet, find and pick up pen, place pen on cup near cabinet
