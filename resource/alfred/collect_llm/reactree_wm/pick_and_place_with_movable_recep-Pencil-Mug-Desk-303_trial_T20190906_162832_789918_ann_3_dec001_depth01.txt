Your task is to: Put a pencil in a cup on the desk.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding pencil, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pencil, find and pick up cup, and place pencil in cup on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pencil, find and pick up cup, place pencil in cup on desk
