Your task is to: put two sets of keys on a sofa
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on sofa, Find and pick up keys away from sofa, and place keys on sofa.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on sofa, Find and pick up keys away from sofa, place keys on sofa
