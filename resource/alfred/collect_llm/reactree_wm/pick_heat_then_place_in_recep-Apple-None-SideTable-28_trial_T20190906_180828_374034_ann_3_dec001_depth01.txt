Your task is to: put a cook apple onto black shelves
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, cook and pick up apple, and place apple on black shelves.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, cook and pick up apple, place apple on black shelves
