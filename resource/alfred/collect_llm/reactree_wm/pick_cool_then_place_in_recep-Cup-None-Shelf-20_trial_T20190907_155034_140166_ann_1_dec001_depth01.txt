Your task is to: Put a cold glass on a shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding glass, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass, cool and pick up glass, and place glass on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass, cool and pick up glass, place glass on shelf
