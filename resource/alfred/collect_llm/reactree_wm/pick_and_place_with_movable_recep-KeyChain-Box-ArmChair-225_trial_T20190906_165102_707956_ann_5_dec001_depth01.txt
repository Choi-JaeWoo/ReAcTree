Your task is to: Put a box with keys on it on a chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, find and pick up keys, and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, find and pick up keys, place box on chair
