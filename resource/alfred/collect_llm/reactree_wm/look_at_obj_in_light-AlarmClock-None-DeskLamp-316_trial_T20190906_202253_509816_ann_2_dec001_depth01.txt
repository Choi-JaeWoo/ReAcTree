Your task is to: Move a clock across the room, turn on lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the clock, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up clock, move clock across room, and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up clock, move clock across room, find and turn on lamp
