Your task is to: Grab the tennis bat on the floor, turn on the lamp on the table by the sofa
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding tennis bat, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tennis bat, and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tennis bat, find and turn on lamp
