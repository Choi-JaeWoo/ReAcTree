Your task is to: move the clock from the table to the dresser
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Desk (1, 2), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding clock, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up clock and place clock on dresser.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up clock, place clock on dresser
