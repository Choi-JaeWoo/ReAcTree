Your task is to: put a container and phone onto a desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up container, place container on desk, find and pick up phone, and place phone on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
