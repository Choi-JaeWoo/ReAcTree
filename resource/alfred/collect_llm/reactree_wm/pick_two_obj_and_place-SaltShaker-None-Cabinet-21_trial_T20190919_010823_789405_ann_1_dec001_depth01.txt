Your task is to:   put the salt into the cabinet that is under  the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding salt, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up salt and place salt in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up salt, place salt in cabinet
