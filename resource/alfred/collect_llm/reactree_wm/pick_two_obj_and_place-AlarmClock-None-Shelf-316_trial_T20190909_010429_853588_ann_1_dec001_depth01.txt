You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the clock, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up clock, place clock on shelf, Find and pick up clock away from shelf, and place clock on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
