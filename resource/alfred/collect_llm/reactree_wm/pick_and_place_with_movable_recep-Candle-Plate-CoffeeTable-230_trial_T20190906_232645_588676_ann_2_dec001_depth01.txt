Your task is to: Put a plate with a strange object on it on the tv stand.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the plate, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on tv stand, find and pick up strange object, and place strange object on plate near tv stand.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on tv stand, find and pick up strange object, place strange object on plate near tv stand
