Your task is to: To put two ladles into a drawer below the stove.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding ladle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up ladle, place ladle in drawer, find and pick up ladle away from drawer, and place ladle in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up ladle, place ladle in drawer, find and pick up ladle away from drawer, place ladle in drawer
