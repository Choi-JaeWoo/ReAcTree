Your task is to: Cool a slice of lettuce
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of lettuce, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, clean and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, clean and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in fridge
