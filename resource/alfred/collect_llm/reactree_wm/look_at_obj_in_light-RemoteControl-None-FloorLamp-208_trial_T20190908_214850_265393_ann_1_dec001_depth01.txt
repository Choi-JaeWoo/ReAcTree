Your task is to: turn on a lamp while holding a remote controller
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a remote controller, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote controller and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote controller, find and turn on lamp
