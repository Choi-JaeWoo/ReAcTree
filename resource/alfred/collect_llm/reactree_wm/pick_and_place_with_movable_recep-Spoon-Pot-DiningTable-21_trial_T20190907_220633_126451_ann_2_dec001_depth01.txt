Your task is to: Put the spoon in the pot and back on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, place spoon in pot, find and pick up pot, and place pot on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in pot, find and pick up pot, place pot on table
