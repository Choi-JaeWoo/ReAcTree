Your task is to: Move two empty toilet rolls to a drawer
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the toilet rolls, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet roll, place toilet roll in drawer, find and pick up toilet roll away from drawer, and place toilet roll in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up toilet roll, place toilet roll in drawer, find and pick up toilet roll away from drawer, place toilet roll in drawer
