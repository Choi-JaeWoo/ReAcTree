Your task is to: Bring the orange cup with knife in it to the counter. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup in counter, find and pick up knife, and place knife on cup near counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place cup in counter, find and pick up knife, place knife on cup near counter
