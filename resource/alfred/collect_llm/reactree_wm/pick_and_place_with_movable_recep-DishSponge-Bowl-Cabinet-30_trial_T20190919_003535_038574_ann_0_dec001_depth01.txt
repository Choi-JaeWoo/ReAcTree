Your task is to: Move a bowl and sponge to a cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding bowl or sponge, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, find and pick up sponge, place bowl in cabinet, and place sponge in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, find and pick up sponge, place bowl in cabinet, place sponge in cabinet
