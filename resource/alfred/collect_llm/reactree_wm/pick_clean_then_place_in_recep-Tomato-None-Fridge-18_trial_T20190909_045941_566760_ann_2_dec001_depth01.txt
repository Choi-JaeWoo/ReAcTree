Your task is to: Put the heated tomato in the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Safe (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Think: Since I’m not holding the tomato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, and place tomato in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, place tomato in fridge
