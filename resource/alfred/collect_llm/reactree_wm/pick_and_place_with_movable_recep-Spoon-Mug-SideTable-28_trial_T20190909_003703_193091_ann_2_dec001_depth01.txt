Your task is to: put mug and spoon onto black shelves
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding mug and spoon, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug on black shelves, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon on black shelves.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug on black shelves, find and pick up spoon, place spoon on black shelves
