Your task is to: Put two sponges on the metal shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Cart (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponges, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponges, and place sponges on metal shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponges, place sponges on metal shelf
