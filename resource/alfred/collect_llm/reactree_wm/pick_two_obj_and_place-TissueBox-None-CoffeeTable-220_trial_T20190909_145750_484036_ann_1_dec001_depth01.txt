Your task is to: Put two boxes of tissue paper on a table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the tissue paper, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tissue paper, place tissue paper on table, Find and pick up tissue paper away from table, and place tissue paper on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tissue paper, place tissue paper on table, Find and pick up tissue paper away from table, place tissue paper on table
