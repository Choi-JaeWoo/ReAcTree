Your task is to: Put a glass bowl with a golden spoon into the kitchen sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a glass bowl, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass bowl, find and pick up golden spoon, place glass bowl in sink basin, and place golden spoon in glass bowl.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass bowl, find and pick up golden spoon, place glass bowl in sink basin, place golden spoon in glass bowl
