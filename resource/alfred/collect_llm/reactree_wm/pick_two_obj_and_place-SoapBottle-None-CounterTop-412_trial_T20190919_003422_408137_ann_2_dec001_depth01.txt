Your task is to: Place two bottles on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding any bottle, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bottle, place bottle on counter, and find and pick up bottle.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bottle, place bottle on counter, find and pick up bottle
