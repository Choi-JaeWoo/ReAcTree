Your task is to: Put a clean golden spoon in a cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a golden spoon, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, clean and pick up spoon, and place spoon in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, clean and pick up spoon, place spoon in cabinet
