Your task is to: cool a pan that was on the stove
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding pan, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, cool and pick up pan, and place pan on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, cool and pick up pan, place pan on counter
