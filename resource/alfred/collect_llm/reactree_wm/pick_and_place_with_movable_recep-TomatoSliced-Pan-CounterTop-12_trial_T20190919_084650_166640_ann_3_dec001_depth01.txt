Your task is to: Put a pan with a cold tomato and a butter knife in it on a counter. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on counter, find and pick up tomato, cool and pick up tomato, and place tomato on pan near counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on counter, find and pick up tomato, cool and pick up tomato, place tomato on pan near counter
