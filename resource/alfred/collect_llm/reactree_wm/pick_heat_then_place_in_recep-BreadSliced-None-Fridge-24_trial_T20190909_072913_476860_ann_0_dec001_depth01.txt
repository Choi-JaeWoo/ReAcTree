Your task is to: pick up knife, cut bread, cook bread in microwave, place bread in to fridge 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, cut and pick up bread, heat and pick up bread, and place bread in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, cut and pick up bread, heat and pick up bread, place bread in fridge
