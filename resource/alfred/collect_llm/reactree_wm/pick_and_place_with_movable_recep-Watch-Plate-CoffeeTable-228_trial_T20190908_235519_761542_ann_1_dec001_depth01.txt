Your task is to: Put a watch on a plate and moved it to the coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the watch, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up watch, place watch on plate, and place plate on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up watch, place watch on plate, place plate on coffee table
