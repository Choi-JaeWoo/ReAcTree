Your task is to: TO move two empty rolls to the right cabinet under the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up roll, place roll in cabinet, find and pick up roll away from cabinet, and place roll in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
