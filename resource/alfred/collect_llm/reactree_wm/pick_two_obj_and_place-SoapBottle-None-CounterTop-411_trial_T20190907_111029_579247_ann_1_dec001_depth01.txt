Your task is to: Put both white bottles by the edge of the tub.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding white bottle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up white bottle, place white bottle by tub, Find and pick up white bottle away from tub, and place white bottle by tub.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up white bottle, place white bottle by tub, Find and pick up white bottle away from tub, place white bottle by tub
