Your task is to: Move the box with a phone in it to the end table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), Cabinet (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box and place box on end table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on end table
