Your task is to: put a bowl with a pen in it on the computer desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bowl, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, find and pick up pen, place pen in bowl, and place bowl on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, find and pick up pen, place pen in bowl, place bowl on desk
