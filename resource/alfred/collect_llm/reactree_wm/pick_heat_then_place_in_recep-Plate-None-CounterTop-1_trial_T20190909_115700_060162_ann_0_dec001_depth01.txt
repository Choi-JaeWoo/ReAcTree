Your task is to: Put a warm plate on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, heat and pick up plate, and place plate on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, heat and pick up plate, place plate on counter
