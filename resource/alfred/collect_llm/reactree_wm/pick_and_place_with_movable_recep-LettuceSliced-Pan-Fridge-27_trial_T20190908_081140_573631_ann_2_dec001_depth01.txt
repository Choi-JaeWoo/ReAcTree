Your task is to: Slice lettuce, put knife and slice of lettuce in pan, put pan in the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, find and pick up pan, place knife and lettuce in pan, and place pan in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, find and pick up pan, place knife and lettuce in pan, place pan in fridge
