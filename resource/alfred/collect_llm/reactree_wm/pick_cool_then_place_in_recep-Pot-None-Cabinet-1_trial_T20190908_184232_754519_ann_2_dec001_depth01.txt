Your task is to: Put a chilled metal pot in a cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding metal pot, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up metal pot, cool and pick up metal pot, and place metal pot in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up metal pot, cool and pick up metal pot, place metal pot in cabinet
