Your task is to: Put a warmed glass in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
Think: Since I’m not holding a glass, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass, heat and pick up glass, find and pick up glass away from sink, and place glass in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass, heat and pick up glass, find and pick up glass away from sink, place glass in sink basin
