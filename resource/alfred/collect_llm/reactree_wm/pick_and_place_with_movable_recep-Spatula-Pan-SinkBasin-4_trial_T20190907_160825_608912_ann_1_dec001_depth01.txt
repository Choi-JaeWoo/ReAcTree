Your task is to: grab the pan and spatula from the table, put them in the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan in sink, find and pick up spatula, and place spatula in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan in sink, find and pick up spatula, place spatula in sink
