Your task is to: cut a slice of bread, chill it, then cook it in the microwave
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of bread, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, and heat and pick up bread.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, heat and pick up bread
