Your task is to: Put a clean tomato on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a tomato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, clean and pick up tomato, and place tomato on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tomato, clean and pick up tomato, place tomato on counter
