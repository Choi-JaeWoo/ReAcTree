Your task is to: Chill an egg in the freezer to put in the microwave.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding egg, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, cool and pick up egg, and place egg in microwave.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, cool and pick up egg, place egg in microwave
