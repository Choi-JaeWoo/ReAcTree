Your task is to: Put two bottles on the middle of the counter in between the two sinks.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bottle, place bottle on counter, find and pick up bottle away from counter, and place bottle on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bottle, place bottle on counter, find and pick up bottle away from counter, place bottle on counter
