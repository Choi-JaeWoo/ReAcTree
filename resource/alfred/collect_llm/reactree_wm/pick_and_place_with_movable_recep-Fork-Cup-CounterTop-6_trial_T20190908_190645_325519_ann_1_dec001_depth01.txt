Your task is to: Put a cup with a fork inside on the counter to the left of the stove.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup on counter, find and pick up fork, and place fork on cup near counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place cup on counter, find and pick up fork, place fork on cup near counter
