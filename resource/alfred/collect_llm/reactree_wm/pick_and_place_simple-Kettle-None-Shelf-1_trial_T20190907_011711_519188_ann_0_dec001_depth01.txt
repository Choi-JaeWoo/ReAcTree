Your task is to: Move a tea pot from the stove to a shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding tea pot, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tea pot and place tea pot on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tea pot, place tea pot on shelf
