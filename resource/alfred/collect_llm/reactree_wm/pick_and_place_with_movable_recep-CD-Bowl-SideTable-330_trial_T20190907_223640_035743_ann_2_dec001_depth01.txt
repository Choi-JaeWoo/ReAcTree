Your task is to: Put a bowl with a cd in it on the nightstand.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl on nightstand, and find and pick up cd.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl on nightstand, find and pick up cd
