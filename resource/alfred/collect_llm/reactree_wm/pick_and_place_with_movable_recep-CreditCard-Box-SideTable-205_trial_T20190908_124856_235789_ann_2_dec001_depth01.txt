Your task is to: Put a box with credit card on the small, round, black table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on small, round, black table, and place credit card on box near small, round, black table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on small, round, black table, place credit card on box near small, round, black table
