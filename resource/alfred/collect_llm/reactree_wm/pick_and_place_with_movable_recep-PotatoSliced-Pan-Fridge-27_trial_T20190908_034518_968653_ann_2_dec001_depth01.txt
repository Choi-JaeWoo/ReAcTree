Your task is to: Place a sliced potato in the silver pan into the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in pan, place pan in fridge, and place potato in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in pan, place pan in fridge, place potato in fridge
