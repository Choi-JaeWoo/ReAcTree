Your task is to: Moving a pan with a knife and sliced cabbage in it in the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a pan, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on countertop, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, and place cabbage on pan near countertop.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on countertop, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, place cabbage on pan near countertop
