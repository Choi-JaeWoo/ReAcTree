Your task is to: Take the bowel. Chill it in the fridge. Heat it up in the microwave.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bowel, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowel, cool and pick up bowel, and heat and pick up bowel.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowel, cool and pick up bowel, heat and pick up bowel
