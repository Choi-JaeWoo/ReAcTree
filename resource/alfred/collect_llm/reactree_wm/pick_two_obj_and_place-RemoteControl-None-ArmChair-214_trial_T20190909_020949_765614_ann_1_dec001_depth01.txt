Your task is to: clean up remote's and put them down on the black chair
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on black chair, Find and pick up remote away from black chair, and place remote on black chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on black chair, Find and pick up remote away from black chair, place remote on black chair
