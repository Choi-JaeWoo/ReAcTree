Your task is to: grab the disc on the dresser, turn on the lamp on the night stand
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Safe (1), LaundryHamper (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding disc, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up disc and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up disc, turn on lamp
