Your task is to: Put two rags on the end table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), SideTable (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), Bathtub (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the rag, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up rag, place rag on end table, Find and pick up rag away from end table, and place rag on end table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up rag, place rag on end table, Find and pick up rag away from end table, place rag on end table
