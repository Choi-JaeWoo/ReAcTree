Your task is to: Move keys to a box and move both to a chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on box, and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on box, place box on chair
