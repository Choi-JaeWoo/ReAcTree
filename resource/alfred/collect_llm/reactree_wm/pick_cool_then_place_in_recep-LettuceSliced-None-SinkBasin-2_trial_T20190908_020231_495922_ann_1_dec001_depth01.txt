Your task is to: Move a cold piece of lettuce to the sink by a knife.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in sink basin, and place knife on lettuce near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in sink basin, place knife on lettuce near sink basin
