Your task is to: Put a white plate with a watch on it on a coffee table shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on coffee table shelf, and place watch on plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on coffee table shelf, place watch on plate
