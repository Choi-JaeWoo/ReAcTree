Your task is to: Turn a lamp on with keys in hand.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the lamp, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lamp and turn on lamp.
OK.
