Your task is to: Put the clean cabbage on the island
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding cabbage, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cabbage, clean and pick up cabbage, place cabbage on island, and place cabbage on island.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cabbage, clean and pick up cabbage, place cabbage on island, and place cabbage on island
