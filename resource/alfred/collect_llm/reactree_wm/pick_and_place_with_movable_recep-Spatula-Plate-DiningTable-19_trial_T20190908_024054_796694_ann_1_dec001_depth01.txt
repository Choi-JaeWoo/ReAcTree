Your task is to: To get the spatula and plate.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spatula, and find and pick up plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spatula, find and pick up plate
