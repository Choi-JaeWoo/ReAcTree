Your task is to: Place two yellow containers on the night stand. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the yellow container, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up yellow container, place yellow container on night stand, find and pick up yellow container away from night stand, and place yellow container on night stand.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up yellow container, place yellow container on night stand, find and pick up yellow container away from night stand, place yellow container on night stand
