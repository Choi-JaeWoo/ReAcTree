Your task is to: Put a cooked potato in the recycling can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a cooked potato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato, cook and pick up potato, and place potato in recycling can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato, cook and pick up potato, place potato in recycling can
