Your task is to: Place a square pan with a spatula inside on the table with bread on it.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on table, find and pick up spatula, and place spatula on pan near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
