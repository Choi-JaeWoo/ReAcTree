Your task is to: put two purple rags on the back of the toilet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), SideTable (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), Bathtub (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding purple rag, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up rag, place rag on toilet, Find and pick up rag away from toilet, and place rag on toilet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up rag, place rag on toilet, Find and pick up rag away from toilet, place rag on toilet
