Your task is to: place a cooled egg on the kitchen counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding the egg, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, cool and pick up egg, and place egg on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, cool and pick up egg, place egg on counter
