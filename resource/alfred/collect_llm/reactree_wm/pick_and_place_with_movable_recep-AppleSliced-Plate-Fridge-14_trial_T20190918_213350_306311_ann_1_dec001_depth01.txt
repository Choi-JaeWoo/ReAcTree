Your task is to: Put a plate with a cut piece of cheese and a knife in a refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cheese, and place cheese on plate near fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cheese, place cheese on plate near fridge
