Your task is to: Place a box with a watch on a chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, open and pick up watch, and place watch on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, open and pick up watch, place watch on chair
