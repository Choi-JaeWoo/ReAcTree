Your task is to: put white plate and keys on black shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding white plate or keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up white plate, place white plate on black shelf, find and pick up keys, and place keys on black shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up white plate, place white plate on black shelf, find and pick up keys, place keys on black shelf
