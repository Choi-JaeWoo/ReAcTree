Your task is to: Removing an orange from the sink for cooling and throwing away.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
Think: Since I’m not holding orange, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up orange, cool and pick up orange, and place orange in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up orange, cool and pick up orange, place orange in trash can
