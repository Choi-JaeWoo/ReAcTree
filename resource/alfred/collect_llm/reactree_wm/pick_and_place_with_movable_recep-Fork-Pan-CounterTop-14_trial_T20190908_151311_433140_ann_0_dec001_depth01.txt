Your task is to: To put a fork in a pan plus move it to the left side counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, place fork in pan, and move pan to left side counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, place fork in pan, move pan to left side counter
