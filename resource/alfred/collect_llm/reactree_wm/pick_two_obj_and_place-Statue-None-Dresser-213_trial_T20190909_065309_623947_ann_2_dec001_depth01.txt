Your task is to: Move two statues from the coffee table to a dresser.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding statues, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statues and place statues on dresser.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statues, place statues on dresser
