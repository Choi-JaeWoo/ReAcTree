You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1), Cart (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge, clean and pick up sponge, and place sponge on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, clean and pick up sponge, place sponge on counter
