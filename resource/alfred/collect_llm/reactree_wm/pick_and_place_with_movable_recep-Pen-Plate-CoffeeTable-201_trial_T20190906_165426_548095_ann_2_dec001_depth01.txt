Your task is to: Put a plate with a pen on a coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, find and pick up pen, and place plate with pen on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, find and pick up pen, place plate with pen on coffee table
