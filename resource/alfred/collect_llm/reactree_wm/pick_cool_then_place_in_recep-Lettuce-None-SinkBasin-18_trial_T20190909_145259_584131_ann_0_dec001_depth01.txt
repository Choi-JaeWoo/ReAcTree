Your task is to: Put a chilled head of lettuce in a sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Safe (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Think: Since I’m not holding a head of lettuce, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up head of lettuce, chill and pick up head of lettuce, place head of lettuce in sink, and place head of lettuce in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up head of lettuce, chill and pick up head of lettuce, place head of lettuce in sink, and place head of lettuce in sink
