Your task is to: Put two papers in the bin.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the paper, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up paper, place paper in bin, find and pick up paper away from bin, and place paper in bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up paper, place paper in bin, find and pick up paper away from bin, place paper in bin
