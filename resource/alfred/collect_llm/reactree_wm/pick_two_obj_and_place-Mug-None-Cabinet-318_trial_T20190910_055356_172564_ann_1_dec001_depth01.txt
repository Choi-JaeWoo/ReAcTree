Your task is to: Move two mugs from the desktop to the desk storage space
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug in desk storage space, find and pick up mug, and place mug in desk storage space.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug in desk storage space, find and pick up mug, place mug in desk storage space
