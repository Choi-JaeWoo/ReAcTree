Your task is to: Put a plate that has a candle on it on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on coffee table, and place candle on plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on coffee table, place candle on plate
