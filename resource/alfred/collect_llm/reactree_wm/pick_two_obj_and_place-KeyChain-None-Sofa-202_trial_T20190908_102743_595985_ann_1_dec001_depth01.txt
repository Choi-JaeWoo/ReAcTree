Your task is to: Move two sets of keys from the coffee table to the couch.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on couch, Find and pick up keys away from couch, and place keys on couch.
OK.
Expand:
