Your task is to: place down a cup with a pen in it on the dresser
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, put pen in cup, and place cup on dresser.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, put pen in cup, place cup on dresser
