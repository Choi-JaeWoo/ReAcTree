Your task is to: Place a fork from the counter into a cup from a cabinet into the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, find and pick up cup, place cup in sink basin, and place fork in cup.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, find and pick up cup, place cup in sink basin, place fork in cup
