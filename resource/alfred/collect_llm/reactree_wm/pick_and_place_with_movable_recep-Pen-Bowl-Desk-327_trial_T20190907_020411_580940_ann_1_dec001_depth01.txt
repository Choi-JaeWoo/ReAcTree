Your task is to: Put the pen from the table to the bowl on the right, move the bowl to the white table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, place pen in bowl, find and pick up bowl, and place bowl on table.
OK.
Expand:
