Your task is to: Put the pot from the table on the counter between the stove and the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding pot, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot on counter, and place pot between stove and fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot on counter, place pot between stove and fridge
