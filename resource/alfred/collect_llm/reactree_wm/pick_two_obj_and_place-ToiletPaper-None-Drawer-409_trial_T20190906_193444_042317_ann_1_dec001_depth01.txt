You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding tube, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tube and place tube next to toilet paper.
OK.
Expand:
