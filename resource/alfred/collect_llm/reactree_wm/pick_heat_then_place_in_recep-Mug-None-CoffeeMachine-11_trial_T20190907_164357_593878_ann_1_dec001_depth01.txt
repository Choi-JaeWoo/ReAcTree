Your task is to: heat the cup from the cabinet in the microwave, put the cup under the coffee machine
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding the cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, heat and pick up cup, and place cup on coffee machine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, heat and pick up cup, place cup on coffee machine
