Your task is to: clean the knife on the counter to place it in a drawer
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, clean and pick up knife, find and pick up drawer, and place knife in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, clean and pick up knife, find and pick up drawer, and place knife in drawer
