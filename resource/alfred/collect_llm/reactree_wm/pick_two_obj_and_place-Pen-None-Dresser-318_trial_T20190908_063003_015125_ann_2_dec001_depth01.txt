Your task is to: Grab two pen and put them on the other side of the desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), Desk (1, 2), Cabinet (1), Bed (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding pen, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, place pen on desk, Find and pick up pen away from desk, and place pen on desk.
OK.
Expand:
