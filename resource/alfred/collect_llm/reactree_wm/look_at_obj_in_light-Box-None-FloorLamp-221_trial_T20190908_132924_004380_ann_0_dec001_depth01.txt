You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, find and turn on floor lamp, and inspect box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, find and turn on floor lamp, inspect box
