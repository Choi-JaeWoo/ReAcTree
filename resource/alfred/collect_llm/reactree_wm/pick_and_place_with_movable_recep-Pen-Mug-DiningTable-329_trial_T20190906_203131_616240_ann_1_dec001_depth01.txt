You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding mug, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place pen in mug, and place mug on table.
OK.
Expand:
