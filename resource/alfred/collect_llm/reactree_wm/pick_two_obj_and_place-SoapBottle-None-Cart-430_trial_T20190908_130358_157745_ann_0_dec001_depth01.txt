Your task is to: Place two white bottles on top metal shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1), Cart (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding white bottles, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up white bottle, place white bottle on metal shelf, find and pick up white bottle away from metal shelf, place white bottle on metal shelf, and find and pick up white bottle away from metal shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up white bottle, place white bottle on metal shelf, find and pick up white bottle away from metal shelf, place white bottle on metal shelf, find and pick up white bottle away from metal shelf
