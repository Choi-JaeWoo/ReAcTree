Your task is to: Place a plate on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the plate, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, and place plate on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on table
