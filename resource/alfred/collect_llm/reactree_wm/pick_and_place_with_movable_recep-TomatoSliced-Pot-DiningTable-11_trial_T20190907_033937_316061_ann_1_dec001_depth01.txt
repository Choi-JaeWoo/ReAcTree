Your task is to: Put a cooking pot with a tomato slice in it on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot in sink basin, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, and place tomato in pot near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot in sink basin, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, place tomato in pot near sink basin
