Your task is to: place two statues on top of the TV stand
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the statue, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue, place statue on TV stand, Find and pick up statue away from TV stand, and place statue on TV stand.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, place statue on TV stand, Find and pick up statue away from TV stand, and place statue on TV stand
