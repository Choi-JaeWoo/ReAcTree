Your task is to: Get the remote and put into the box and move it to the chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote in box, and move box to chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote in box, move box to chair
