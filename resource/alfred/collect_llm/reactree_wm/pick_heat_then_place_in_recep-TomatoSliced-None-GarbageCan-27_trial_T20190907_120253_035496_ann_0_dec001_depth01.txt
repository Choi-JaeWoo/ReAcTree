Your task is to: Place a slice of microwaved tomato into the trash can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of tomato, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, find and pick up knife, and place tomato in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tomato, heat and pick up tomato, find and pick up knife, place tomato in trash can
