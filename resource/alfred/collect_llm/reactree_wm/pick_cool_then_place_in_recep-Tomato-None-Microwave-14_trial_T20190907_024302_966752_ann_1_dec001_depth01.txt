Your task is to: Grab the tomato put it in the refrigerator, take it out. Take the tomato to the microwave put it in.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding tomato, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, place tomato in fridge, take tomato out of fridge, find and pick up tomato, and place tomato in microwave.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
