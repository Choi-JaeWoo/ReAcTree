Your task is to: Set two statues on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue, place statue on table, find and pick up statue away from table, and place statue on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, place statue on table, find and pick up statue away from table, place statue on table
