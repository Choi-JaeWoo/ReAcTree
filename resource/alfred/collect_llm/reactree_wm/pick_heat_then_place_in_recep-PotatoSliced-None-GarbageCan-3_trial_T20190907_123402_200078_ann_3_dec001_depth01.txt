Your task is to: Place a heated slice of a potato into a recycling bin. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of potato, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, and place potato in recycling bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, place potato in recycling bin
