Your task is to: Place a bowl with a CD on the bedside table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl on bedside table, and find and pick up CD.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl on bedside table, find and pick up CD
