Your task is to: put washed egg inside microwave
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding egg, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, clean and pick up egg, and place egg inside microwave.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, clean and pick up egg, place egg inside microwave
