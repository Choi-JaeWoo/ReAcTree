Your task is to: Place a mug with a spoon in it on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug on table, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon in mug near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug on table, find and pick up spoon, place spoon in mug near table
