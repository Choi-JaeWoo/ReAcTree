Your task is to: Cool a piece of apple and place it in the trash can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding a piece of apple, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, cool and pick up apple, and place apple in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, cool and pick up apple, place apple in trash can
