Your task is to: Put an empty roll as well as an full roll of toilet paper on the bathroom counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding toilet paper, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet paper, place toilet paper on counter, and find and pick up toilet paper away from counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up toilet paper, place toilet paper on counter, find and pick up toilet paper away from counter
