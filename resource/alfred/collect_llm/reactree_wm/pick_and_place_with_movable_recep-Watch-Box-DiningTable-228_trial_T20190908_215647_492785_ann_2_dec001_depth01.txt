Your task is to: place a carton with a watch in it on the table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up carton, place carton on table, and find and pick up watch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up carton, place carton on table, find and pick up watch
