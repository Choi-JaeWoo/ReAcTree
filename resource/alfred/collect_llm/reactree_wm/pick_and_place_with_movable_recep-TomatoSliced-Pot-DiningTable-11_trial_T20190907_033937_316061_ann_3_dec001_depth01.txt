Your task is to: To cut a tomato slice plus putting it into a pot as well as moving the pot from the stove to a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, place tomato in pot, and move pot to table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, place tomato in pot, move pot to table
