Your task is to: Examine a key chain by the dim natural light of a living room.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding key chain, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up key chain and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up key chain, find and turn on lamp
