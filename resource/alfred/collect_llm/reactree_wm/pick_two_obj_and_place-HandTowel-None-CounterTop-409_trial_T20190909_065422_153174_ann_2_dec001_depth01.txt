Your task is to: remove the towels from the wall and put them on the sink counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding towels, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up towels, place towels on sink counter, and find and pick up towels away from sink counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up towels, place towels on sink counter, find and pick up towels away from sink counter
