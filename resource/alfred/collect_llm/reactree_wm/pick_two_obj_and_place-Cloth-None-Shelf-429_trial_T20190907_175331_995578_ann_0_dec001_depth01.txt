Your task is to: Take the rags out of of the tub and to the hamper.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding rags, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up rags and place rags in hamper.
OK.
