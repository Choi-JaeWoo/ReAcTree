Your task is to: Putting a bowl with a knife and egg slice in it on the white table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl on table, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up egg, and place egg on bowl near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl on table, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up egg, place egg on bowl near table
