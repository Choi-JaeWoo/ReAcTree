Your task is to: Put a warm wine glass in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding wine glass, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up wine glass, heat and pick up wine glass, and place wine glass in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up wine glass, heat and pick up wine glass, place wine glass in sink
