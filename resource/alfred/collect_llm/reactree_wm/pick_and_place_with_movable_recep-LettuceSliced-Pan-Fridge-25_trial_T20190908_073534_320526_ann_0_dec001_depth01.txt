Your task is to: Put lettuce in a pan into the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding the lettuce, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in pan, place pan in fridge, and find and pick up lettuce away from fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in pan, place pan in fridge, find and pick up lettuce away from fridge
