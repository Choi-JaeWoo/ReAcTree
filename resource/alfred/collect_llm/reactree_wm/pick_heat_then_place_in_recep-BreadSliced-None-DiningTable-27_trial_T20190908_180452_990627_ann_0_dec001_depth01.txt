Your task is to: Put a cooked slice of bread on a table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bread, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bread, cook and pick up bread, and place bread on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bread, cook and pick up bread, place bread on table
