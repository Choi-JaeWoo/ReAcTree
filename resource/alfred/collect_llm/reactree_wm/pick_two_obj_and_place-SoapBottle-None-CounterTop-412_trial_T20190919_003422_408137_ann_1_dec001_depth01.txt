Your task is to: Put two bottle of soap on the bathroom vanity between the two sinks.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding the soap, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap, place soap on vanity, Find and pick up soap away from vanity, and place soap on vanity.
OK.
