Your task is to: Put a heated potato in the kitchen sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding potato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, and place potato in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato, heat and pick up potato, place potato in sink basin
