Your task is to: Turn off a lamp with a remote. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, and turn off lamp with remote.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, turn off lamp with remote
