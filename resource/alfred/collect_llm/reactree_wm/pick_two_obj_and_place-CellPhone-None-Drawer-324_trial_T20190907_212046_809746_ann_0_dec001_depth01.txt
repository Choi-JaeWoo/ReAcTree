Your task is to: place two phones inside the drawer
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up phone, place phone in drawer, find and pick up phone away from drawer, and place phone in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up phone, place phone in drawer, find and pick up phone away from drawer, place phone in drawer
