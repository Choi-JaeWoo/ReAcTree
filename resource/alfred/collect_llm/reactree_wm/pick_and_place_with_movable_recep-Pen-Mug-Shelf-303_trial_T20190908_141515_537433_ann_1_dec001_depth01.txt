Your task is to: Put a cup with a pen inside on the side to the left of the mirror.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place pen in cup, and place cup on side table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place pen in cup, place cup on side table
