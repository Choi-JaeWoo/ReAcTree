Your task is to: Put a remote in the box and move them to the couch.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote in box, find and pick up box, and place box on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote in box, find and pick up box, place box on couch
