Your task is to: Put a box from the couch with a phone in it on the black desk.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on desk, Find and pick up phone, and place phone on desk.
OK.
