Your task is to: Put a pan with an ice cream scoop in it on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
Think: Since I’m not holding the pan, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on countertop, and place ice cream scoop on pan.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on countertop, place ice cream scoop on pan
