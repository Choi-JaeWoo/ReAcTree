Your task is to: place a bowl with a spoon in the cupboards in the kitchen
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl in cupboard, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon on bowl near cupboard.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl in cupboard, find and pick up spoon, place spoon on bowl near cupboard
