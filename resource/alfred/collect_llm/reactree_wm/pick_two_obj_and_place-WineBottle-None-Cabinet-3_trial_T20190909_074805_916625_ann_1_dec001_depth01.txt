Your task is to: take both bottles of wine and place them in the left drawer that is beneath the counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up wine bottle, place wine bottle in drawer, find and pick up wine bottle, and place wine bottle in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up wine bottle, place wine bottle in drawer, find and pick up wine bottle, place wine bottle in drawer
