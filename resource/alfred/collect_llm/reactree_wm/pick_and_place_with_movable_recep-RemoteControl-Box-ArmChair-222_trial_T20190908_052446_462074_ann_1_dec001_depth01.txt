Your task is to: Move a remote control into a box and set it on the chair cushion
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote control, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote control, put remote control into box, and place box on chair cushion.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote control, put remote control into box, place box on chair cushion
