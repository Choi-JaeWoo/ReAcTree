Your task is to: cut the lettuce into pieces and put it on the table by the microwave
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, slice and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce on table
