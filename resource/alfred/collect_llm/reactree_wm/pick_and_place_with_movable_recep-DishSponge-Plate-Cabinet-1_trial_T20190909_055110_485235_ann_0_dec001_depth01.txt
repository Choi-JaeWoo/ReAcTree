Your task is to: Put a sponge on a white plate to put away next to the stove in a cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge, place sponge on plate, and place plate on cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge on plate, place plate on cabinet
