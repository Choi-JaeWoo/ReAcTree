Your task is to: Store 2 empty toilet paper rolls in the cabinet under the sink that is the closest to the toilet. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), Shelf (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding toilet paper roll, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet paper roll, place toilet paper roll in cabinet, find and pick up toilet paper roll away from cabinet, and place toilet paper roll in cabinet.
OK.
