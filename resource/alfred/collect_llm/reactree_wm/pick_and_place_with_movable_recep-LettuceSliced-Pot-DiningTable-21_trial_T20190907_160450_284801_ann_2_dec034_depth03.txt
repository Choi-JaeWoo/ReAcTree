Your primary goal is to: Cut a head of lettuce, place a slice in a pot, put the pot on the white table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in pot, and and place pot on white table.
Your task is to: and place pot on white table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot on white table, find and pick up knife, and slice and pick up lettuce.
OK.
