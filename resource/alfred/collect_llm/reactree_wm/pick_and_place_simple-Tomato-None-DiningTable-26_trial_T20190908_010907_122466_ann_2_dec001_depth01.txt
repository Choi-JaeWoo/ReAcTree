Your task is to: Get the tomato from the fridge and place it on the table in front of the bread. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding the tomato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, place tomato on table, and place tomato in front of bread.
OK.
