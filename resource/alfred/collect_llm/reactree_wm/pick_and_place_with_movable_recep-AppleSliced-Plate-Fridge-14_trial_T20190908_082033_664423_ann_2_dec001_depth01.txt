Your task is to: Put the apple slice on the plate in the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple slice, find and pick up plate, place apple slice on plate, and place plate in refrigerator.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple slice, find and pick up plate, place apple slice on plate, place plate in refrigerator
