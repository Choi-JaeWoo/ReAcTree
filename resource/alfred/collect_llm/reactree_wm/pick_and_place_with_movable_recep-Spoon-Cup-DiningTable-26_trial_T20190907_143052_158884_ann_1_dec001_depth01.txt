Your task is to: Put a wine glass with a spoon in it on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up wine glass, place wine glass on table, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon in wine glass near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up wine glass, place wine glass on table, find and pick up spoon, place spoon in wine glass near table
