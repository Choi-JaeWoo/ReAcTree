Your task is to: Put a spoon in the sink. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
Think: Since I’m not holding a spoon, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon and place spoon in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in sink
