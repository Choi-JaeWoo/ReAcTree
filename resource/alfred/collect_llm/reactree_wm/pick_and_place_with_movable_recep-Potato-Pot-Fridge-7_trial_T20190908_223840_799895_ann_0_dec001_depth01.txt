Your task is to: place pot inside a fridge with a potato in it
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding the pot, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot in fridge, and place potato in pot.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot in fridge, place potato in pot
