Your task is to: Put a watch in a box on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the watch, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up watch, place watch in box, and place box on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up watch, place watch in box, place box on table
