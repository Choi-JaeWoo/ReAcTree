Your task is to: place a cooled pan on the front left stove burner
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding the pan, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, cool and pick up pan, and place pan on stove burner.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, cool and pick up pan, place pan on stove burner
