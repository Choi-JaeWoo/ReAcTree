Your task is to: turn on the  lamp while holding the card
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the card, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up card and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
