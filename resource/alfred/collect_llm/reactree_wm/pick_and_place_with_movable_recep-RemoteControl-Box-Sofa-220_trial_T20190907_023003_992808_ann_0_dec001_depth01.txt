Your task is to: place a box down on the couch with a remote in it
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on couch, and put remote in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on couch, put remote in box
