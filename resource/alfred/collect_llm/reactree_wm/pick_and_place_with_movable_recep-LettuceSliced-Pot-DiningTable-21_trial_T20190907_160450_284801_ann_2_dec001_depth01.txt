Your task is to: Cut a head of lettuce, place a slice in a pot, put the pot on the white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in pot, and place pot on white table.
OK.
