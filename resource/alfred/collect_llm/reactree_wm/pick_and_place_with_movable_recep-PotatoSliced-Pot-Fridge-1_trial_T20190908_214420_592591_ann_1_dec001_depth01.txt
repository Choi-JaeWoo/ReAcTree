Your task is to: Put a butterknife and a pot with a potato slice in the fridge
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding the butterknife, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up butterknife, place butterknife in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, and place potato in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up butterknife, place butterknife in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, and place potato in fridge
