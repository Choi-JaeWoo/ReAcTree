Your task is to: Put a cup and spoon away in a cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 6 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup in cabinet, find and pick up spoon, place spoon in cabinet, find and pick up cup away from cabinet, and place cup in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place cup in cabinet, find and pick up spoon, place spoon in cabinet, find and pick up cup away from cabinet, place cup in cabinet
