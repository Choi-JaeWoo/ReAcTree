Your task is to: Put two heads of lettuce in the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding the lettuce, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in fridge, find and pick up lettuce away from fridge, and place lettuce in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in fridge, find and pick up lettuce away from fridge, place lettuce in fridge
