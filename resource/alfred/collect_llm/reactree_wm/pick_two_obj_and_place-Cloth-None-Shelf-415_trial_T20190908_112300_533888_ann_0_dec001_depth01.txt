Your task is to: Put two cloth under the shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding cloth, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cloth, place cloth under shelf, Find and pick up cloth away from shelf, and place cloth under shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cloth, place cloth under shelf, Find and pick up cloth away from shelf, place cloth under shelf
