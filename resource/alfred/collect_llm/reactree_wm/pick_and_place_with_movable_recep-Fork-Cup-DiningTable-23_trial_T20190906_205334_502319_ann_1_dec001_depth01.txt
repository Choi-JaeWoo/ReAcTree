Your task is to: Put a glass with a metal fork in it on the kitchen island.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up glass, place glass on island, find and pick up fork, and place fork on glass near island.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up glass, place glass on island, find and pick up fork, place fork on glass near island
