Your task is to: Examine a small statue by the light of an end table lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Shelf (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding statue, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up statue and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up statue, find and turn on lamp
