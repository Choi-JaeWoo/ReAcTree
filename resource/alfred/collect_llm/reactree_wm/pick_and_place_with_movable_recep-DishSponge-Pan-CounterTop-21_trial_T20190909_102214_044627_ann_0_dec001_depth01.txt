Your task is to: put a sponge in a pan and put the pan on the counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a sponge, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge, place sponge in pan, and place pan on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge in pan, place pan on counter
