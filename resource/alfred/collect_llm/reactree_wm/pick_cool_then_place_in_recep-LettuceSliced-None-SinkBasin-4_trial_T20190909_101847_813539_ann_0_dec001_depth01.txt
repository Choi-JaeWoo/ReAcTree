Your task is to: Chill a slice of cabbage in the fridge, place in the sink afterwards.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of cabbage, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, place cabbage in fridge, and place cabbage in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, place cabbage in fridge, place cabbage in sink
