Your task is to: Pick up the remote then turn off the floor lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, find and turn off floor lamp, and place remote on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, find and turn off floor lamp, place remote on couch
