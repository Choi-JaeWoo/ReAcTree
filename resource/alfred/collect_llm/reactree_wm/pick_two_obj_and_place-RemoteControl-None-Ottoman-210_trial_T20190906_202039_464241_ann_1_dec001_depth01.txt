Your task is to: place two remote controllers on top of the foot rest
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on foot rest, Find and pick up remote away from foot rest, and place remote on foot rest.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on foot rest, Find and pick up remote away from foot rest, place remote on foot rest
