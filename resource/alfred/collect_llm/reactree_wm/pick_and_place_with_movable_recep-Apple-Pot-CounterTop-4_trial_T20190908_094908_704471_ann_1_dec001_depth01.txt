Your task is to: Put a apple inside a pot beside the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding a apple, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, place apple in pot, and place pot beside sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, place apple in pot, place pot beside sink
