Your task is to: Move two saltshakers out of cupboards onto the countertop
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a saltshaker, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up saltshaker, place saltshaker on countertop, find and pick up saltshaker away from countertop, and place saltshaker on countertop.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up saltshaker, place saltshaker on countertop, find and pick up saltshaker away from countertop, place saltshaker on countertop
