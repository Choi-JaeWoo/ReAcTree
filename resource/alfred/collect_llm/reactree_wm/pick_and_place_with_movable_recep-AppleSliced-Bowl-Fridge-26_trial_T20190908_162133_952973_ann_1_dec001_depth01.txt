Your task is to: Put an apple slice into a bowl and place it inside the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bowl, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl in fridge, find and pick up apple slice, and place apple slice in bowl near fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place bowl in fridge, find and pick up apple slice, place apple slice in bowl near fridge
