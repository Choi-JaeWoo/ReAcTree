Your task is to: Place a bowl with a pencil in it on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl in table, and place pencil in bowl near table.
OK.
