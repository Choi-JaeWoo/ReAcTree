Your task is to: To put a pen in a mug and put the mug on the night stand. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding pen, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, find and pick up mug, and place pen in mug on night stand.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pen, find and pick up mug, place pen in mug on night stand
