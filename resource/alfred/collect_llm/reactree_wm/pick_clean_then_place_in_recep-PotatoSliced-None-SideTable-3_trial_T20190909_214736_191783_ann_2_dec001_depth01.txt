Your task is to: Place a clean potato slice on a plate.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, clean and pick up potato, and place potato on plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, clean and pick up potato, place potato on plate
