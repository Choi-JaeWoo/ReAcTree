Your task is to: heat the tray on the bed stool
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding tray, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tray, heat and pick up tray, and place tray on bed stool.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tray, heat and pick up tray, place tray on bed stool
