Your task is to: Put the two keys on the cabinet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on cabinet, Find and pick up keys away from cabinet, and place keys on cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on cabinet, Find and pick up keys away from cabinet, place keys on cabinet
