Your task is to: put a blue object in the safe on the floor
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a blue object, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up blue object and place blue object in safe.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up blue object, place blue object in safe
