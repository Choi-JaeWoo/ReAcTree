Your task is to: Retrieve a remote control, put in box, put box on coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, put remote in box, and put box on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, put remote in box, put box on coffee table
