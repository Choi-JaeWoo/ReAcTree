Your task is to: put box with watch on chair
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on chair
