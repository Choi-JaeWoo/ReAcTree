Your task is to: Put an apple in a pot on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding apple, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up apple, and put apple in pot.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up apple, put apple in pot
