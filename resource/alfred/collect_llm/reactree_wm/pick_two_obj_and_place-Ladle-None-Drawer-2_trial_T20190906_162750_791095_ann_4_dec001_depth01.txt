Your task is to: put two spoons in a drawer
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, place spoon in drawer, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in drawer, find and pick up spoon, place spoon in drawer
