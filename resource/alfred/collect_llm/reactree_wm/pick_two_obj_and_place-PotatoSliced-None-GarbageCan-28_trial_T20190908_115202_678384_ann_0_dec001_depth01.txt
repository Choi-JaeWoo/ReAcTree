Your task is to: Put two slices of potato into the garbage can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of potato, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in garbage can, find and pick up potato away from garbage can, and place potato in garbage can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in garbage can, find and pick up potato away from garbage can, place potato in garbage can
