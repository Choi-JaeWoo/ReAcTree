Your task is to: Put two green bottles away in a cabinet below the roll of paper towels.

Think: Since I’m not holding green bottle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up green bottle, find and pick up green bottle, place green bottle in cabinet, and place green bottle in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
