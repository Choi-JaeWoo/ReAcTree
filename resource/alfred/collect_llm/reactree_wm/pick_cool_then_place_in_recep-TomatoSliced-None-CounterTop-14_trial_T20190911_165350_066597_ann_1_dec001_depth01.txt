Your task is to: Put a cold slice of tomato on a counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of tomato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, and place tomato on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up tomato, place tomato on counter
