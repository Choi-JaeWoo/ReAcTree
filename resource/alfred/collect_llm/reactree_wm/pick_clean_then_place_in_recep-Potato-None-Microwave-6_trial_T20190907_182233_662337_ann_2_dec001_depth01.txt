Your task is to: Put a clean potato in the microwave.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding the potato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato, clean and pick up potato, and place potato in microwave.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato, clean and pick up potato, place potato in microwave
