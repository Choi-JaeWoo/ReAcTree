Your task is to: Move a bowl and sponge to the cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, find and pick up sponge, and place bowl and sponge in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, find and pick up sponge, place bowl and sponge in cabinet
