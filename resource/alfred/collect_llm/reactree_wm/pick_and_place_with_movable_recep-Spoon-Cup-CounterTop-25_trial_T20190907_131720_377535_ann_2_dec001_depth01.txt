Your task is to: Put a spoon in a cold cup, put the cup with spoon on the counter left of the microwave. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, place spoon in cup, cool and pick up cup, and place cup on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in cup, cool and pick up cup, place cup on counter
