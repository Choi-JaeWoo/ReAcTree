Your task is to: Slice the potato using the knife.  Put the knife in the fridge with the potato in the pan. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in pan, place pan in fridge, and place knife in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in pan, place pan in fridge, place knife in fridge
