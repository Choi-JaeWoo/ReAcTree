Your primary goal is to: Put a pot with a sponge in it in a sink.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up pot, place pot in sink basin, and place sponge in pot near sink basin.
Your task is to: place sponge in pot near sink basin
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge and place sponge in pot near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge in pot near sink basin
