Your task is to: Put a remote in a box on the black desk. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, find and open box, and place remote in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, find and open box, place remote in box
