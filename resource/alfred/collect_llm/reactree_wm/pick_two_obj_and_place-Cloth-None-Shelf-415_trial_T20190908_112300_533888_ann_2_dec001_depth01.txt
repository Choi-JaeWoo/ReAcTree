Your task is to: Move two tissues to a shelf
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the tissue, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tissue, place tissue on shelf, Find and pick up tissue away from shelf, and place tissue on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tissue, place tissue on shelf, Find and pick up tissue away from shelf, place tissue on shelf
