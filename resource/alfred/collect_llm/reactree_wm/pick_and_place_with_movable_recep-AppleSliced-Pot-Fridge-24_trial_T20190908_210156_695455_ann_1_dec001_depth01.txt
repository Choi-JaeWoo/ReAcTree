Your task is to: Place slice of fruit on the top shelf in the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of fruit, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up fruit, place fruit in fridge, find and pick up fruit away from fridge, and place fruit in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up fruit, place fruit in fridge, find and pick up fruit away from fridge, place fruit in fridge
