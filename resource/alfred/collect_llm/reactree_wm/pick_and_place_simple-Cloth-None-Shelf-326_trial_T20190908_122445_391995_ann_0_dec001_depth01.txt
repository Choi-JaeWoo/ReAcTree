Your task is to: Move a cloth from the floor to a shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding cloth, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cloth and place cloth on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cloth, place cloth on shelf
