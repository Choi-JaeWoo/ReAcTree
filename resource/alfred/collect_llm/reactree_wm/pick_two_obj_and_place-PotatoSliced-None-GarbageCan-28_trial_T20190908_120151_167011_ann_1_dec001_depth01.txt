Your task is to: Slice one of two potatoes that you put in the garbage.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding a potato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, and place potato in garbage.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato, slice and pick up potato, place potato in garbage
