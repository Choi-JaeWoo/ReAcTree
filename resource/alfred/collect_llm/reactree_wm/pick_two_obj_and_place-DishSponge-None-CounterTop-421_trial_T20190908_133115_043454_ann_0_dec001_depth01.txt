Your task is to: Place two scrub sponges on the opposite sides of a sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding scrub sponges, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up scrub sponges, place scrub sponges on sink basin, and place scrub sponges on opposite sides of sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up scrub sponges, place scrub sponges on sink basin, place scrub sponges on opposite sides of sink basin
