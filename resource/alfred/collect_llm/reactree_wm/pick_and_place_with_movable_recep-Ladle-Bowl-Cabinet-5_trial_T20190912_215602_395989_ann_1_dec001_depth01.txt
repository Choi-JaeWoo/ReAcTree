Your task is to: Put a bowl with an ice cream scoop in it in a cupboard.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place bowl in cupboard, find and pick up ice cream scoop, and place ice cream scoop in bowl near cupboard.
OK.
Expand:
