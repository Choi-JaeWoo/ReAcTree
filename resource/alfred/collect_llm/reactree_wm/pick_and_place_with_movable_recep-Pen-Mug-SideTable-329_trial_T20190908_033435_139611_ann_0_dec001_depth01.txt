You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding mug, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, find and pick up pen, and place mug with pen on night stand.
OK.
