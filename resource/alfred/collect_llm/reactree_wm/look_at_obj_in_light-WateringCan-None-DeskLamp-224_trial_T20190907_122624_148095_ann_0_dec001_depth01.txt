Your task is to: Grab the white pot on the floor, turn on the lamp on the end table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), Cabinet (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, find and turn on lamp
