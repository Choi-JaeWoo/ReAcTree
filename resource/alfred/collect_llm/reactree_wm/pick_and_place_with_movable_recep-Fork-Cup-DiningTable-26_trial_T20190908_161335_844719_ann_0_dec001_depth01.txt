Your task is to: Put a fork inside a cup on the white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding fork, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, find and pick up cup, and place fork in cup.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, find and pick up cup, place fork in cup
