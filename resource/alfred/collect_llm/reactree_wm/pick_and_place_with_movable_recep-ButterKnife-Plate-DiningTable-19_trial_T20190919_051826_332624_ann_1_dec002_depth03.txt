Your primary goal is to: Move a butterknife and plate to a table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move butterknife to table, and move plate to table.
Your task is to: move butterknife to table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding butterknife, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up butterknife, and place butterknife on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up butterknife, place butterknife on table
