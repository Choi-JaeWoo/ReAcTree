Your task is to: Put a box with a candle in it on a stand.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on stand, and place candle in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on stand, place candle in box
