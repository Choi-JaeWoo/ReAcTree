Your task is to: Put two rags on the shelf to the right of the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding any rag, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up rag, place rag on shelf, find and pick up rag away from shelf, and place rag on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up rag, place rag on shelf, find and pick up rag away from shelf, place rag on shelf
