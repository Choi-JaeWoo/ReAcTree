Your task is to: Move ladle to bowl, place in sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding ladle, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up ladle, place ladle in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up ladle, place ladle in sink
