Your task is to: Put the spoons from the sink in the drawer on the left farthest away on stove side.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoons, place spoons in sink basin, find and pick up spoons, and place spoons in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoons, place spoons in sink basin, find and pick up spoons, place spoons in drawer
