Your task is to: Put a vase on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding vase, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up vase and place vase on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up vase, place vase on counter
