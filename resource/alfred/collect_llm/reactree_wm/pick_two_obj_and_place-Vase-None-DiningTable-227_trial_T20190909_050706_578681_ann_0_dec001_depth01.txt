Your task is to: Put a red round object, a silver vase on the white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding vase, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up vase, place vase on table, and place vase on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up vase, place vase on table, place vase on table
