Your task is to: Put a white plate with a credit card on it on top of a black shelving unit.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a white plate, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on shelf, find and pick up credit card, and place credit card on plate near shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on shelf, find and pick up credit card, place credit card on plate near shelf
