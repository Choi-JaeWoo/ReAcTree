Your task is to: Take the salt shakers from the table to the cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
Think: Since I’m not holding salt shakers, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up salt shakers and place salt shakers on cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up salt shakers, place salt shakers on cabinet
