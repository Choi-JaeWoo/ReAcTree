Your task is to: to wash off a piece of green fruit and put it back where you found it. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding a piece of green fruit, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up a piece of green fruit, clean and pick up a piece of green fruit, and place a piece of green fruit back where you found it.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up a piece of green fruit, clean and pick up a piece of green fruit, place a piece of green fruit back where you found it
