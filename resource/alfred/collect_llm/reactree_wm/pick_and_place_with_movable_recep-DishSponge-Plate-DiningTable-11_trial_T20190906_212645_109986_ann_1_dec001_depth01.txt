Your task is to: put a blue plate with a sponge on it on top of the white kitchen table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on table, find and pick up sponge, and place sponge on plate near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on table, find and pick up sponge, place sponge on plate near table
