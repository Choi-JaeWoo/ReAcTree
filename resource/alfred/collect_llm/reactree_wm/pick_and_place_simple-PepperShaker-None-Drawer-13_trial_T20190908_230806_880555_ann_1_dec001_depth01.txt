Your task is to: Place a salt shaker inside of a drawer. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
Think: Since I’m not holding a salt shaker, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up salt shaker, open and pick up drawer, and place salt shaker in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up salt shaker, open and pick up drawer, place salt shaker in drawer
