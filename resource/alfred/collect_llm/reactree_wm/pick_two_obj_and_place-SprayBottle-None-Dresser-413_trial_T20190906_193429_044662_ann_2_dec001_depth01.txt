Your task is to: Put two bottles of window cleaner on top of the dresser. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the window cleaner, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up window cleaner, place window cleaner on dresser, Find and pick up window cleaner away from dresser, and place window cleaner on dresser.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up window cleaner, place window cleaner on dresser, Find and pick up window cleaner away from dresser, place window cleaner on dresser
