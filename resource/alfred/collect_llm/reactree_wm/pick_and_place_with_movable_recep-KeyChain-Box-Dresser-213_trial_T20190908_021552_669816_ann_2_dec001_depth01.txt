Your task is to: Put a box of keys in front of a TV screen.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box of keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box of keys and place box of keys in front of TV screen.
OK.
