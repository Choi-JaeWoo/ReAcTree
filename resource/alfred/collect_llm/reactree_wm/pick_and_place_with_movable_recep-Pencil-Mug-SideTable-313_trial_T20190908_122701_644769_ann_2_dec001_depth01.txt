Your task is to: put a mug and a pencil on a small table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug on table, find and pick up pencil, and place pencil on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
