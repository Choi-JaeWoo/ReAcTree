Your task is to: Put two candlesticks away in the leftmost, lower drawer.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up candlestick, place candlestick in drawer, find and pick up candlestick away from drawer, and place candlestick in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
