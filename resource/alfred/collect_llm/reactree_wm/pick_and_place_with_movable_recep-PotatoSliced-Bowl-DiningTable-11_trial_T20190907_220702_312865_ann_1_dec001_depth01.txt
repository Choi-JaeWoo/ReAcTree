Your task is to: Place a chilled, clear, glass plate with a piece of potato on it onto the table in the corner.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, cool and pick up plate, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, and place potato on plate near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, cool and pick up plate, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato on plate near table
