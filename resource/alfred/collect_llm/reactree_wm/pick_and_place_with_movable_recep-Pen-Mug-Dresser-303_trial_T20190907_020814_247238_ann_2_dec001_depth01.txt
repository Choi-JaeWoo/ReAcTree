Your task is to: Put the pen and mug on the dresser.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, place pen on dresser, find and pick up mug, and place mug on dresser.
OK.
Expand:
