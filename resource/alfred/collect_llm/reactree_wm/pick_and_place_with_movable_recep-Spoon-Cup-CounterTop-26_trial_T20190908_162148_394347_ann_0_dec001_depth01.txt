Your task is to: Put a spoon in a cup on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding spoon, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, find and pick up cup, and place spoon in cup.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, find and pick up cup, place spoon in cup
