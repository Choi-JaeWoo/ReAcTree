Your task is to: Place a chilled slice of cabbage on the counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of cabbage, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, chill and pick up cabbage, and place cabbage on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up cabbage, chill and pick up cabbage, place cabbage on counter
