Your task is to: place a cooled apple slice on top of the black table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a cooled apple slice, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, cool and pick up apple, and place apple on black table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up apple, cool and pick up apple, place apple on black table
