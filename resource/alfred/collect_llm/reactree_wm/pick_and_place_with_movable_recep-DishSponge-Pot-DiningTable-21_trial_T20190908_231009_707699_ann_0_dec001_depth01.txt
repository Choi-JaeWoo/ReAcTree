Your task is to: Move the pot with the green sponge in it from the stove to the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, place pot on stove, find and pick up sponge, and place sponge on pot near stove.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, place pot on stove, find and pick up sponge, place sponge on pot near stove
