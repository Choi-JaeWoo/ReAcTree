Your task is to: Put two tomatoes to the left of the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, place tomato to the left of sink, find and pick up tomato, and place tomato to the left of sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tomato, place tomato to the left of sink, find and pick up tomato, place tomato to the left of sink
