Your task is to: Put a potato slice in a cold bowl, and put the bowl on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up bowl, place potato in bowl, and place bowl on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, cool and pick up bowl, place potato in bowl, place bowl on table
