Your task is to: Slice a lettuce, wash a slice
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of lettuce, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Slice a lettuce, wash a slice
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: slice a lettuce, wash a slice
