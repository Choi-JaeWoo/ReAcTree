Your task is to: Put keys on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys and place keys on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on table
