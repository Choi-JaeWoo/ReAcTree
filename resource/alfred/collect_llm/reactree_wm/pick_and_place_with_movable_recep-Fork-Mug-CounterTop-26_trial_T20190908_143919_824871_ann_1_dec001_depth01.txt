Your task is to: Move the mug in the sink to the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding mug, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, and place mug on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug on counter
