Your task is to: place two toilet rolls (one used, one new) on to the counter with two sinks 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up toilet roll, place toilet roll on counter, find and pick up toilet roll, and place toilet roll on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up toilet roll, place toilet roll on counter, find and pick up toilet roll, place toilet roll on counter
