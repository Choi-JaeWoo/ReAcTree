Your task is to: Throw away a tomato slice that was cooked in the microwave.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato slice, heat and pick up tomato slice, and place tomato slice in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tomato slice, heat and pick up tomato slice, place tomato slice in trash can
