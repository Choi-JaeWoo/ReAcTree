Your task is to: Put the butter knife in the black bowl, put the bowl in the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up butter knife, place butter knife in black bowl, find and pick up black bowl, and place black bowl in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up butter knife, place butter knife in black bowl, find and pick up black bowl, place black bowl in sink basin
