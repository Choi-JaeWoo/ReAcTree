Your task is to: Move a plunger from the floor to a cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), Shelf (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), CounterTop (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding plunger, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plunger and place plunger in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
