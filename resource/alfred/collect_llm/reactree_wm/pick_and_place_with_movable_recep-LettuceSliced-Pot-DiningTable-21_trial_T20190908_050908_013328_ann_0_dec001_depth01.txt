Your task is to: Move a pan with a slice of lettuce to a white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a pan with a slice of lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, put lettuce in pan, and move pan to white table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, put lettuce in pan, move pan to white table
