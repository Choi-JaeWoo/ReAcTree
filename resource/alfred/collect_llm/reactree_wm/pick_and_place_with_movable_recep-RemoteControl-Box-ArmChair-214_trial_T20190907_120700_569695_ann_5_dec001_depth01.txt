Your task is to: Put a box holding a remote control on the seat of a chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on chair, and place remote control on box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on chair, place remote control on box
