Your task is to: put a pan with a spoon in it on the kitchen island counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan on counter, find and pick up spoon, and place spoon on pan near counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan on counter, find and pick up spoon, place spoon on pan near counter
