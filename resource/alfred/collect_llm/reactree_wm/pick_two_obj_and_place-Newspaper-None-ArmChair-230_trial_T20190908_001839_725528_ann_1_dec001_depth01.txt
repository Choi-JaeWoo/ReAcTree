Your task is to: Put two papers on the chair closest to the couch
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the paper, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up paper, place paper on chair, Find and pick up paper away from chair, and place paper on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up paper, place paper on chair, Find and pick up paper away from chair, place paper on chair
