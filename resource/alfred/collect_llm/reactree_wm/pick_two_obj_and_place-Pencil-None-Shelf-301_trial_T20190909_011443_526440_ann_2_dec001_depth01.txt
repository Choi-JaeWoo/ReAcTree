Your task is to: Move two blue pencils from the desktop to the shelf at the back of the desk
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding blue pencils, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up blue pencil, place blue pencil on shelf, Find and pick up blue pencil away from shelf, and place blue pencil on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up blue pencil, place blue pencil on shelf, Find and pick up blue pencil away from shelf, place blue pencil on shelf
