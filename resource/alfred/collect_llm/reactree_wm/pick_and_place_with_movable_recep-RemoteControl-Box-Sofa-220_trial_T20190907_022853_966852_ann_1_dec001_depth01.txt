Your task is to: Place a cardboard box containing a remote control on the couch.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, open and pick up remote control, and place remote control on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, open and pick up remote control, place remote control on couch
