Your task is to: Put two liquid soap into the cupboard
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CounterTop (1, 2), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding liquid soap, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up liquid soap, place liquid soap in cupboard, find and pick up liquid soap away from cupboard, and place liquid soap in cupboard.
OK.
Expand:
