Your task is to: Microwave a knife with a piece of bread then put the bread on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, place knife in microwave, find and pick up bread, and place bread on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, place knife in microwave, find and pick up bread, place bread on table
