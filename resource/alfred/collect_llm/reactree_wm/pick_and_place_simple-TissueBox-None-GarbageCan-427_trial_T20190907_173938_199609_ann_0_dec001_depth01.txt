Your task is to: place a paper box in the bin 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the paper box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up paper box, and place paper box in bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up paper box, place paper box in bin
