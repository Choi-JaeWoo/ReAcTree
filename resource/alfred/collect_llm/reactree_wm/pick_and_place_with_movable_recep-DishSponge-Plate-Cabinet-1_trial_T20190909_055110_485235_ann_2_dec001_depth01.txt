Your task is to: To move a stack into the cabinet. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding a stack, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up stack and place stack in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up stack, place stack in cabinet
