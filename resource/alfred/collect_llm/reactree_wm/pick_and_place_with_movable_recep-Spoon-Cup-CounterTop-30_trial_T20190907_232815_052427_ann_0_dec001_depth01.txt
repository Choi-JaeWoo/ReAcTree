Your task is to: To put a spoon in a bowl and set it on the table in the center of the kitchen.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding spoon, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, place spoon in bowl, and place bowl on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in bowl, place bowl on table
