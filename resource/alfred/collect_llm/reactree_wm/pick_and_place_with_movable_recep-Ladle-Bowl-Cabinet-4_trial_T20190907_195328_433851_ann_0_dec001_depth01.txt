Your task is to: put the spoon and the plate into the door under the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spoon, place spoon in door, find and pick up plate, and place plate in door.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spoon, place spoon in door, find and pick up plate, and place plate in door
