Your task is to: take the spray bottle from the bathtub to the toilet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CounterTop (1, 2), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding spray bottle, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spray bottle and place spray bottle on toilet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
