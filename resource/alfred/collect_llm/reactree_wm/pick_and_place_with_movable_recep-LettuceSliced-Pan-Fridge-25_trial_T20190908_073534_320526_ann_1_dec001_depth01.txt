Your task is to: Place a knife and a slice of fruit on a pan in the fridge.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up fruit, and place fruit on pan near fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up fruit, place fruit on pan near fridge
