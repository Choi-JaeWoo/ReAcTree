Your task is to: place a clean spatula inside of the pullout drawer in the corner of the kitchen
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CounterTop (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
Think: Since I’m not holding spatula, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spatula, clean and pick up spatula, and place spatula in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spatula, clean and pick up spatula, place spatula in drawer
