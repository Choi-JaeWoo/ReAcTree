Your task is to: Heat up a piece of slice tomato.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding slice tomato, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up slice tomato, heat up and pick up slice tomato, and place slice tomato on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up slice tomato, heat up and pick up slice tomato, place slice tomato on counter
