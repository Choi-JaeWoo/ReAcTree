Your task is to: Put the green sponge in the pan, put the pan in the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding green sponge, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up green sponge, place green sponge in pan, and place pan in sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up green sponge, place green sponge in pan, place pan in sink
