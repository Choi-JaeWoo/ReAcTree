Your task is to: Put two object on a night stand.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the object, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up object, place object on night stand, find and pick up object away from night stand, and place object on night stand.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up object, place object on night stand, find and pick up object away from night stand, place object on night stand
