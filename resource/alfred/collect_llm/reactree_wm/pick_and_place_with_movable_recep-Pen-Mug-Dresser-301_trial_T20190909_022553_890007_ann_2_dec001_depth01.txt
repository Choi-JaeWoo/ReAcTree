Your task is to: Put the mug with pen on top of the cabinet 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up mug, place mug on cabinet, find and pick up pen, and place pen on mug near cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up mug, place mug on cabinet, find and pick up pen, place pen on mug near cabinet
