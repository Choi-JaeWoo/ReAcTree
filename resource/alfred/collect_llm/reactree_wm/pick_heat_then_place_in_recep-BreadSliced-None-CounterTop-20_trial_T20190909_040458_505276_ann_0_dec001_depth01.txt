Your task is to: Put a knife in the microwave, and a slice of bread on the counter. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, place knife in microwave, find and pick up bread, and place bread on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, place knife in microwave, find and pick up bread, place bread on counter
