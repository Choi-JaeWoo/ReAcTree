Your task is to: put the pen in the cup, move the cup to the right a little
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1), LaundryHamper (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pen, place pen in cup, find and pick up cup, and move cup to the right a little.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pen, place pen in cup, find and pick up cup, move cup to the right a little
