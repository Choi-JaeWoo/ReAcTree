Your task is to: Move the cup with red pen in it to the table from the night stand
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Desk (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, move and pick up cup, and place cup on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, move and pick up cup, place cup on table
