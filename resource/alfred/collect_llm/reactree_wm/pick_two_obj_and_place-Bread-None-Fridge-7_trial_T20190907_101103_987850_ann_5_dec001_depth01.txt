Your task is to: Store the bread in the refrigerator 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bread, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, and place bread in fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, place bread in fridge
