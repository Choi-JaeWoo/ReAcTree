Your task is to: Put two towels on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding towels, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up towels, place towels on counter, and find and pick up towels away from counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up towels, place towels on counter, find and pick up towels away from counter
