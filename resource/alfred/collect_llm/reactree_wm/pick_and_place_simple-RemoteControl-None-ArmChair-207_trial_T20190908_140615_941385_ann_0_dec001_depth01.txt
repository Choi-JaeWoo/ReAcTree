Your task is to: Put the remote on a chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, and place remote on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on chair
