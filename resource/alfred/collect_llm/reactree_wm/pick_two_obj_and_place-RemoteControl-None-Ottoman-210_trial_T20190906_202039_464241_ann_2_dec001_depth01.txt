Your task is to: Place two remote controls in the room on the ottoman next to each other.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on ottoman, Find and pick up remote away from ottoman, and place remote on ottoman.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on ottoman, Find and pick up remote away from ottoman, and place remote on ottoman
