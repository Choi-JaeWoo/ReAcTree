Your task is to: Grab the box on the table, turn off the floor lamp by the sofa
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, and turn off floor lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, turn off floor lamp
