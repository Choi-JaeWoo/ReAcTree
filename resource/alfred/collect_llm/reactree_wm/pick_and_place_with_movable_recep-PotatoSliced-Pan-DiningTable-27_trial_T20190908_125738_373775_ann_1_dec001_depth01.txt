Your task is to: Take a potato slice from the microwave and put it in the silver pan to put on the white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Think: Since I’m not holding a potato slice, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up potato slice, place potato slice in pan, and place pan on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up potato slice, place potato slice in pan, place pan on table
