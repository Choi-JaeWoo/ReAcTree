Your task is to: Take the CD to place it on top of the shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding CD, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up CD and place CD on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up CD, place CD on shelf
