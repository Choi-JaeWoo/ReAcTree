Your task is to: Put both green sponges on either side of the empty sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding green sponge, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up green sponge, place green sponge on left side of sink, find and pick up green sponge, and place green sponge on right side of sink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up green sponge, place green sponge on left side of sink, find and pick up green sponge, place green sponge on right side of sink
