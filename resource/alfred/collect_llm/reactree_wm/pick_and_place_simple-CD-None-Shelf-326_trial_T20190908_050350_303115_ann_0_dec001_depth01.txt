Your task is to: Move a CD to the desk cubby area
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding CD, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up CD, and place CD on desk cubby area.
OK.
