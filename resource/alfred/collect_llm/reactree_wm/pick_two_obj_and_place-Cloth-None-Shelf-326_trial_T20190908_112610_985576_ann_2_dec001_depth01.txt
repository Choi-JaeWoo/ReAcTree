Your task is to: Put black and yellow cloth on the top shelf 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding black and yellow cloth, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up black and yellow cloth, and place black and yellow cloth on top shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up black and yellow cloth, place black and yellow cloth on top shelf
