Your task is to: Move two lids from the dresser to the nightstand. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding any lid, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up lid, place lid on nightstand, Find and pick up lid away from nightstand, and place lid on nightstand.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up lid, place lid on nightstand, Find and pick up lid away from nightstand, place lid on nightstand
