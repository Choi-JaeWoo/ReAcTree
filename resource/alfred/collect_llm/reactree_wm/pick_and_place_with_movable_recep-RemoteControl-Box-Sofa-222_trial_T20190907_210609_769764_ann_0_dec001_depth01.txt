Your task is to: Put the remote away in the box on the couch.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote in box, Find and pick up remote away from box, and place remote in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote in box, Find and pick up remote away from box, and place remote in box
