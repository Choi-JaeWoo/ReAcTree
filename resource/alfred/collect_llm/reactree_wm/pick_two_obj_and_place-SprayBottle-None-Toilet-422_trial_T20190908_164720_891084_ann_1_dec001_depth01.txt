Your task is to: clean up spray bottles and put them on top of the toilet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding spray bottles, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spray bottles, clean and pick up spray bottles, and place spray bottles on toilet.
OK.
