Your task is to: Put two soap bars in the sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding soap bars, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap bars, place soap bars in sink basin, and place soap bars in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap bars, place soap bars in sink basin, place soap bars in sink basin
