Your task is to: Put a full and an empty roll of toilet paper in the upper middle drawer of the bathroom vanity.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), CounterTop (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up full roll of toilet paper, place full roll of toilet paper in drawer, find and pick up empty roll of toilet paper, and place empty roll of toilet paper in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up full roll of toilet paper, place full roll of toilet paper in drawer, find and pick up empty roll of toilet paper, place empty roll of toilet paper in drawer
