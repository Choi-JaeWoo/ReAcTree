Your task is to: Move a racket from the floor to the bed.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding racket, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up racket and place racket on bed.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up racket, place racket on bed
