Your task is to: Put a card into a box on the couch
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), CoffeeTable (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the card, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up card, find and pick up box, and place card in box on couch.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
