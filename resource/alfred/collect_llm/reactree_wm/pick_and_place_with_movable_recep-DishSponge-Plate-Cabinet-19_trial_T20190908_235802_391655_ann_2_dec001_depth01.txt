Your task is to: Place gray plate with green sponge in end bottom cabinet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding gray plate, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up gray plate, and place gray plate in end bottom cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up gray plate, place gray plate in end bottom cabinet
