Your task is to: Place a pot containing lettuce on a counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding a pot containing lettuce, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pot, put lettuce in pot, and place pot on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pot, put lettuce in pot, place pot on counter
