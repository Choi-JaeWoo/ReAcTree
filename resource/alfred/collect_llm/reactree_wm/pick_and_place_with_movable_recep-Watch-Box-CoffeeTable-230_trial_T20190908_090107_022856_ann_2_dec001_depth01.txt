Your task is to: Put a box with a watch in it, on the coffee table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding box, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, and place box on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on coffee table
