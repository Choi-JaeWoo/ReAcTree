Your task is to: Put a coffee cup with a pencil inside it on the dark brown bookshelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the coffee cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up coffee cup, find and pick up pencil, and place coffee cup on bookshelf.
OK.

- control flow: sequence
