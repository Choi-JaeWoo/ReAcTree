Your task is to: place a place with keys on it on top of the white table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on table, and find and pick up keys.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on table, find and pick up keys
