Your task is to: Place microwaved red pepper slice on left corner of counter with microwave
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of red pepper, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up red pepper, heat and pick up red pepper, and place red pepper on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up red pepper, heat and pick up red pepper, place red pepper on counter
