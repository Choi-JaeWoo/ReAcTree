Your task is to: Put the watch on a tray and onto the side table against the wall.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the watch, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up watch, place watch on tray, and place tray on side table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up watch, place watch on tray, place tray on side table
