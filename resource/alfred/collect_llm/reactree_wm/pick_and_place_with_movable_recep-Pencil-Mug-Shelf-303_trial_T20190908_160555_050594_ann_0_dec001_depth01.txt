Your task is to: Put a coffee cup with a pencil on the bookshelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the cup, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, find and pick up pencil, and place cup and pencil on bookshelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, find and pick up pencil, place cup and pencil on bookshelf
