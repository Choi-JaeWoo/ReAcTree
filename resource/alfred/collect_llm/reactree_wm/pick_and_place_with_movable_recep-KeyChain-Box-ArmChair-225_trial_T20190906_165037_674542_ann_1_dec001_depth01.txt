Your task is to: Put a box with keys in it on the chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, put keys in box, and place box on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, put keys in box, place box on chair
