Your task is to: Move two sets of keys into a safe.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys in safe, Find and pick up keys away from safe, and place keys in safe.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys in safe, Find and pick up keys away from safe, place keys in safe
