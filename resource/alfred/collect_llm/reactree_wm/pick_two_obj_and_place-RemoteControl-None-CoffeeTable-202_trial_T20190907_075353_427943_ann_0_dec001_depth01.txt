Your task is to: Place two remote controls on a wooden table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote control, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote control, place remote control on table, Find and pick up remote control away from table, and place remote control on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote control, place remote control on table, Find and pick up remote control away from table, place remote control on table
