Your task is to: Put keys on a plate and return them to a table
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on plate, and place plate on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on plate, place plate on table
