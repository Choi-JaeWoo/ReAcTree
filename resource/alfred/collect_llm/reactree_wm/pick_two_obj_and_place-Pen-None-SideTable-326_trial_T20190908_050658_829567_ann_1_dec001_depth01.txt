Your task is to: Put the pens on the night stand
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the pens, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pens, cool and pick up pens, and place pens on night stand.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pens, cool and pick up pens, place pens on night stand
