Your task is to: Put a slice of vegetable on a counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of vegetable, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up vegetable, clean and pick up vegetable, and place vegetable on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up vegetable, clean and pick up vegetable, place vegetable on counter
