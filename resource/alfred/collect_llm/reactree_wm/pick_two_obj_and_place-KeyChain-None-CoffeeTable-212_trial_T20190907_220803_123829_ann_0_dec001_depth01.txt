Your task is to: Put two sets of keys on the coffee table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1, 2), Sofa (1), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on coffee table, Find and pick up keys away from coffee table, and place keys on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
