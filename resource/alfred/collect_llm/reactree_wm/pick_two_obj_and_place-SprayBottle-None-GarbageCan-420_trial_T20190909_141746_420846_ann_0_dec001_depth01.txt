Your task is to: Put two bottles in the bin from the end table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), SideTable (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), Bathtub (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bottle, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bottle, place bottle in bin, find and pick up bottle away from bin, and place bottle in bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bottle, place bottle in bin, find and pick up bottle away from bin, place bottle in bin
