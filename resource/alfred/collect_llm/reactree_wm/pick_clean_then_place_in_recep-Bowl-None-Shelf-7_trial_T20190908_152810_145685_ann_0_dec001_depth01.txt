Your task is to: Clean a bowl and fill it with water to display on a shelf.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding bowl, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, clean and pick up bowl, fill and pick up bowl, and place bowl on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, clean and pick up bowl, fill and pick up bowl, place bowl on shelf
