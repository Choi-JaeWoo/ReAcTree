Your task is to: examine keys with the lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Safe (1), LaundryHamper (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), Desk (1), Cabinet (1, 2), Bed (1), ArmChair (1, 2, 3).
Think: Since I’m not holding keys, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
