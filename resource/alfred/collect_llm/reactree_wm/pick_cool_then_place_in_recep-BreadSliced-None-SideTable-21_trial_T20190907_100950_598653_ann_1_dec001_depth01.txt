Your task is to: Put a slice of chilled bread on the black table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of bread, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, and place bread on black table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, cool and pick up bread, place bread on black table
