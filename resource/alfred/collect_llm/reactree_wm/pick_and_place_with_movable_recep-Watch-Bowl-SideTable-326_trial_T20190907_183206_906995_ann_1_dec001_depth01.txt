Your task is to: Put the watch in the bowl and put it away on the bedside table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), DiningTable (1), Bed (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the watch, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up watch, place watch in bowl, find and pick up bowl, and place bowl on bedside table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up watch, place watch in bowl, find and pick up bowl, place bowl on bedside table
