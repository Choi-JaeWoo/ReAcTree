Your task is to: Look at a cd under the light of a lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding cd, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cd and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cd, find and turn on lamp
