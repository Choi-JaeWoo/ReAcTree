Your task is to: Put the cooked egg in the kitchen sink
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding the egg, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up egg, cook and pick up egg, and place egg in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up egg, cook and pick up egg, place egg in sink basin
