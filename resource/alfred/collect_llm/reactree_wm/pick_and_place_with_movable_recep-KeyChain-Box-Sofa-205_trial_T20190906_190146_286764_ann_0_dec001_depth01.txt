Your task is to: Place the keys in the box on the sofa.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4), DiningTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys in box, Find and pick up keys away from box, and place keys in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys in box, Find and pick up keys away from box, place keys in box
