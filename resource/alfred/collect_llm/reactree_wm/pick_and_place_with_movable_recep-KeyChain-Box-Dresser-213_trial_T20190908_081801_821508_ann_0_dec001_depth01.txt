Your task is to: To put the keys in a box. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, find and pick up box, and place keys in box.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, find and pick up box, place keys in box
