Your task is to: Put two remote controls on to the grey arm chair
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote control, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote control, place remote control on arm chair, Find and pick up remote control away from arm chair, and place remote control on arm chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote control, place remote control on arm chair, Find and pick up remote control away from arm chair, place remote control on arm chair
