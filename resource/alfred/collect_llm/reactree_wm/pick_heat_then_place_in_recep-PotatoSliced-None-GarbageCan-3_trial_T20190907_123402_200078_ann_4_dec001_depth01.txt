Your task is to: Cook the corner of a slice of bread, then throw it out.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding a slice of bread, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, heat and pick up bread, and throw out bread.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up bread, heat and pick up bread, throw out bread
