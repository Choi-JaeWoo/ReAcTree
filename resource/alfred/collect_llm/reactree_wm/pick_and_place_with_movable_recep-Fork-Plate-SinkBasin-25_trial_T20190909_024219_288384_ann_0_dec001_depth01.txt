Your task is to: To put a fork on a plate and put the plate in the sink. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, place fork on plate, find and pick up plate, and place plate in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, place fork on plate, find and pick up plate, and place plate in sink basin
