Your task is to: Place two sets of keys on a chair.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up keys, place keys on chair, Find and pick up keys away from chair, and place keys on chair.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up keys, place keys on chair, Find and pick up keys away from chair, place keys on chair
