Your task is to: Put the chilled bottle onto the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bottle, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bottle, cool and pick up bottle, and place bottle on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bottle, cool and pick up bottle, place bottle on counter
