Your task is to: Slice potato to put in fridge and sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in fridge, find and pick up potato away from fridge, and place potato in sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up potato, place potato in fridge, find and pick up potato away from fridge, place potato in sink basin
