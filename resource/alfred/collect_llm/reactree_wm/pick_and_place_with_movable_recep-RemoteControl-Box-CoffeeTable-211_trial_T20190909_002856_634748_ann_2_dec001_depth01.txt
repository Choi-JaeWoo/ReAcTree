Your task is to: Place the remote in a box on a table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote in box, and place box on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote in box, place box on table
