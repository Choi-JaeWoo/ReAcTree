Your primary goal is to: Slice a lettuce, wash a slice
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: slice a lettuce, and wash a slice.
Your task is to: slice a lettuce
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding a knife, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up knife, and slice and pick up lettuce.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce
