Your task is to: Put a bowl with a CD on a end table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16), Bed (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding a bowl, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowl, place CD in bowl, and place bowl on end table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowl, place CD in bowl, place bowl on end table
