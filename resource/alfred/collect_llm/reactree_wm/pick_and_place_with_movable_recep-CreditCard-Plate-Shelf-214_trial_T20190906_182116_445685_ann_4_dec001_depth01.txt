Your task is to: Put a white plate with a credit card on it on the bench.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on bench, and place credit card on plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on bench, place credit card on plate
