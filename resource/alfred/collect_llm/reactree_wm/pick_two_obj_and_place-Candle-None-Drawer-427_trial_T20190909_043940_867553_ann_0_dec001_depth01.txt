You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CounterTop (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the candle stick, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up candle stick, place candle stick in drawer, find and pick up candle stick away from drawer, and place candle stick in drawer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up candle stick, place candle stick in drawer, find and pick up candle stick away from drawer, place candle stick in drawer
