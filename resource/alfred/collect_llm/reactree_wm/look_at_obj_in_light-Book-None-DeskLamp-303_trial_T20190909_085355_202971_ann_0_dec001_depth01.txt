Your task is to: examine the book with the lamp
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Desk (1), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding book, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up book and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up book, find and turn on lamp
