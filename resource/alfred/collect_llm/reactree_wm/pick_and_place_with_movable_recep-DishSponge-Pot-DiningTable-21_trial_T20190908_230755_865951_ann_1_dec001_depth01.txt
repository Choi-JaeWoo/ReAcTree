Your task is to: To put a sponge in a pan and put the pan down on the table. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4).
Think: Since I’m not holding sponge, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up sponge, place sponge on pan, and place pan on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up sponge, place sponge on pan, place pan on table
