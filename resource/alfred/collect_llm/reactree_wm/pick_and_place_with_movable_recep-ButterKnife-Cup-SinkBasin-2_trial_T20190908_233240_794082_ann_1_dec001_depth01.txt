Your task is to: Put a cup with a butter knife in it in the sink.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cup, place cup in sink basin, find and pick up knife, and place knife on cup near sink basin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cup, place cup in sink basin, find and pick up knife, place knife on cup near sink basin
