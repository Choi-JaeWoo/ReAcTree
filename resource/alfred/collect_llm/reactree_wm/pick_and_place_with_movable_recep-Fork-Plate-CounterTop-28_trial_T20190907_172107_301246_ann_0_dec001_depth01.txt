Your task is to: To put a fork on a plate on the counter next to the toaster. 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), SideTable (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).
Think: Since I’m not holding a fork, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up fork, place fork on plate, and place plate on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up fork, place fork on plate, place plate on counter
