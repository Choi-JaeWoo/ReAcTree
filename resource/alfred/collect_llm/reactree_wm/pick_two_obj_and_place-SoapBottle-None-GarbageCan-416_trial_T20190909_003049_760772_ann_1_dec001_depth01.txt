Your task is to: put two pumper bottles into a bin
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2), CounterTop (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the pumper bottles, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pumper bottle, place pumper bottle in bin, find and pick up pumper bottle away from bin, and place pumper bottle in bin.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pumper bottle, place pumper bottle in bin, find and pick up pumper bottle away from bin, place pumper bottle in bin
