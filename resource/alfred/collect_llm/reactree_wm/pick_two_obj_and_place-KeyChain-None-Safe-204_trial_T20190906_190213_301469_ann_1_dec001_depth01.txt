Your task is to: place both keys in the safe on the ground
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Safe (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1), Desk (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the keys, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up key, place key in safe, Find and pick up key away from safe, and place key in safe.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up key, place key in safe, Find and pick up key away from safe, place key in safe
