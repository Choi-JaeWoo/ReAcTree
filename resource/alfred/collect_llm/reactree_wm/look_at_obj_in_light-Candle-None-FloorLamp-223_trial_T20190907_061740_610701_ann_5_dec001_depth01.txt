You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1, 2), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2, 3).
Think: Since I’m not holding the candle, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up candle, and find and turn on floor lamp.
OK.
