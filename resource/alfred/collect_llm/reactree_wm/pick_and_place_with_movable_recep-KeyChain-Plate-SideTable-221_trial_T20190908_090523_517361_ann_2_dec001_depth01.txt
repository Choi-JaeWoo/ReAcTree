Your task is to: Put a plate with keys on it on the white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place plate on table, find and pick up keys, and place keys on plate near table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place plate on table, find and pick up keys, place keys on plate near table
