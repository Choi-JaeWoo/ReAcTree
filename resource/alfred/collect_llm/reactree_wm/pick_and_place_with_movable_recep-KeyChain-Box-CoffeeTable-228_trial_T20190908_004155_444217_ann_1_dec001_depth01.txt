Your task is to: Put a box with keys in it on the table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place keys in box, and place box on table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place keys in box, place box on table
