Your task is to: clean up a rag inside the tub and put it on the shelf 
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Cart (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding rag, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up cloth, clean and pick up cloth, and place rag on shelf.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up cloth, clean and pick up cloth, place cloth on shelf
