Your task is to: Move the bowls from the mantle to the cabinet.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), Cabinet (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding bowls, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bowls and place bowls on cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bowls, place bowls on cabinet
