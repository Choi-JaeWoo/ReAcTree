Your task is to: Place a pan with lettuce in the refrigerator.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27).
Think: Since I’m not holding a pan with lettuce, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up pan, place pan in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce in pan near fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up pan, place pan in fridge, find and pick up knife, slice and pick up lettuce, place lettuce in pan near fridge
