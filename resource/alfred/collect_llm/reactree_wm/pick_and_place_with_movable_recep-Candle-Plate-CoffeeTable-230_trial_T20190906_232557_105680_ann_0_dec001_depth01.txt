Your task is to: Put a grey plate with a candle on it on a coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding plate, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up plate, place candle on plate, and place plate on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up plate, place candle on plate, place plate on coffee table
