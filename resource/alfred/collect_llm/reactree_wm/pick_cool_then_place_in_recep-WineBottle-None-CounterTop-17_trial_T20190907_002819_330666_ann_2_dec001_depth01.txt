Your task is to: Place a chilled bottle of wine on the counter.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding the bottle of wine, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up bottle of wine, cool and pick up bottle of wine, and place bottle of wine on counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up bottle of wine, cool and pick up bottle of wine, place bottle of wine on counter
