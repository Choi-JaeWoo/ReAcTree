Your task is to: place two spray bottles on top of the drying rack
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4), HandTowelHolder (1, 2), GarbageCan (1), Cart (1), Bathtub (1), BathtubBasin (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding spray bottle, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up spray bottle, place spray bottle on drying rack, and find and pick up spray bottle away from drying rack.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up spray bottle, place spray bottle on drying rack, find and pick up spray bottle away from drying rack
