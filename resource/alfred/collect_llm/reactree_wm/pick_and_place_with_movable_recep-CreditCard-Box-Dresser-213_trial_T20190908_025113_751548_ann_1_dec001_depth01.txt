Your task is to: Put the credit card in the box and next to the TV.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding the credit card, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up credit card, place credit card in box, find and pick up box, and place box near TV.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up credit card, place credit card in box, find and pick up box, place box near TV
