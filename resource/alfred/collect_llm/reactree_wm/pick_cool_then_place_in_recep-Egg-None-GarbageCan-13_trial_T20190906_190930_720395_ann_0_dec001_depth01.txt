Your task is to: Throw the white object from the sink into the trash.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
Think: Since I’m not holding white object, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up white object, place white object in trash can, and throw white object into trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up white object, place white object in trash can, throw white object into trash can
