Your task is to: Take the clock to the desk and turn on the lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), GarbageCan (1), Desk (1, 2), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the clock, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up clock, place clock on desk, and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up clock, place clock on desk, find and turn on lamp
