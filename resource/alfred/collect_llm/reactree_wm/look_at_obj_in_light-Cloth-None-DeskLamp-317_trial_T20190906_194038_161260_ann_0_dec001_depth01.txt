Your task is to: Turn on a light as you hold a green washcloth.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bedroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see SideTable (1), Safe (1), LaundryHamper (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), Bed (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding light, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up light and turn on light.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up light, turn on light
