Your task is to: Place a blue plate with a piece of sliced lettuce on it on a white table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), DiningTable (1, 2), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up blue plate, place blue plate on white table, find and pick up lettuce, and place lettuce on blue plate near white table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up blue plate, place blue plate on white table, find and pick up lettuce, place lettuce on blue plate near white table
