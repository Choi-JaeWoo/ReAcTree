Your task is to: Place a box and a credit card on a desk.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding anything, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, place box on desk, find and pick up credit card, and place credit card on desk.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, place box on desk, find and pick up credit card, place credit card on desk
