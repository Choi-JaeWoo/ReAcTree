Your task is to: Throw two bars of soap into the trash can.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the bathroom, Looking quickly around the room, you see TowelHolder (1, 2), Toilet (1), ToiletPaperHanger (1), Sink (1), SinkBasin (1, 2), SideTable (1), HandTowelHolder (1), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), Bathtub (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding two bars of soap, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up soap, throw and pick up soap, and place soap in trash can.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up soap, throw and pick up soap, place soap in trash can
