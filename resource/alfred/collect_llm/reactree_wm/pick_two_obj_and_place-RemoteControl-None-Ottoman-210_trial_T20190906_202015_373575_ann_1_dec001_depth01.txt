Your task is to: Place two remotes onto the foot stool.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), Ottoman (1), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1, 2), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), CoffeeTable (1, 2), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding the remote, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up remote, place remote on foot stool, Find and pick up remote away from foot stool, and place remote on foot stool.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up remote, place remote on foot stool, Find and pick up remote away from foot stool, place remote on foot stool
