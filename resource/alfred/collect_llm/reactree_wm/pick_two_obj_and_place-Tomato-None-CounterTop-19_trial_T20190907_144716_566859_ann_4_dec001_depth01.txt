Your task is to: Put two tomato's on the kitchen counter
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), DiningTable (1), CounterTop (1, 2), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21).
Think: Since I’m not holding a tomato, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tomato, place tomato on counter, find and pick up tomato away from counter, place tomato on counter, and find and pick up tomato away from counter.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tomato, place tomato on counter, find and pick up tomato away from counter, place tomato on counter, find and pick up tomato away from counter
