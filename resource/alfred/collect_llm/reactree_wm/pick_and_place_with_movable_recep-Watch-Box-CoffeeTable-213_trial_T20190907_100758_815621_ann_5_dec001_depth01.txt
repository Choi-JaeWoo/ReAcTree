Your task is to: Put a box with a wristwatch in it in the center of a coffee table.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see Sofa (1), SideTable (1, 2, 3), GarbageCan (1), Dresser (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), DiningTable (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1, 2).
Think: Since I’m not holding box, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box, find and pick up wristwatch, and place box on coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box, find and pick up wristwatch, place box on coffee table
