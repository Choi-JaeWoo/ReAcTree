Your task is to: Look at a box of tissues by the lamp.
You are in the house, and you arrive at the living room, Looking quickly around the room, you see TVStand (1), Sofa (1, 2), SideTable (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), GarbageCan (1), Drawer (1), CoffeeTable (1), ArmChair (1).
Think: Since I’m not holding box of tissues, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up box of tissues and find and turn on lamp.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up box of tissues, find and turn on lamp
