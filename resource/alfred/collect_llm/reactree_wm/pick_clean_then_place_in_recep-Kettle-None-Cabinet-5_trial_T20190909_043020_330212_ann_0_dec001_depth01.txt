Your task is to: place a clean tea kettle inside of the kitchen cabinet
You are in the house, and you arrive at the kitchen, Looking quickly around the room, you see Toaster (1), StoveBurner (1, 2, 3, 4), SinkBasin (1), Shelf (1, 2, 3), Microwave (1), GarbageCan (1), Fridge (1), Drawer (1, 2, 3), CounterTop (1, 2, 3), CoffeeMachine (1), Cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
Think: Since I’m not holding tea kettle, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially to solve the task. Find and pick up tea kettle, clean and pick up tea kettle, and place tea kettle in cabinet.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up tea kettle, clean and pick up tea kettle, place tea kettle in cabinet
