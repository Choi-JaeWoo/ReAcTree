Your task is to: Robot, please put the wine, cupcake, juice, pudding, and apple on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the wine on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table
