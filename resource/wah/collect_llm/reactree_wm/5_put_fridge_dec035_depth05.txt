Your primary goal is to: take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice, and find the fridge and put down the 1 pound cake and 1 juice.
Your task is to: find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the 1 pound cake and 1 juice
OK.
Act: recall location of juice
You saw juice 2 near kitchen table 1 in kitchen 1. You saw juice 1 near kitchen table 1 in kitchen 1.
Act: recall location of pound cake
You have not seen pound cake before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice in one of the rooms. The 1 pound cake and 1 juice are more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice.
OK.
