Your primary goal is to: Go to the kitchen and collect the following items from the kitchen table and carry them to the coffee table in the lounge:1 pudding, 1 bottle of wine, 1 apple and 1 juice drink.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: go to the kitchen, collect the following items from the kitchen table and carry them to the coffee table in the lounge:1 pudding, 1 bottle of wine, and 1 apple and 1 juice drink.
Your task is to: 1 apple and 1 juice drink
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the apple on the coffee table, and move the juice drink on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple on the coffee table, move the juice drink on the coffee table
