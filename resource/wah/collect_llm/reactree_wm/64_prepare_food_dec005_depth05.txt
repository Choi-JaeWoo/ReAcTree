Your primary goal is to: move the drink on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the drink, and find the kitchen table and put down the drink.
Your task is to: find and pick up the drink
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the drink
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You have not seen cupcake before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the drink in one of the rooms. The drink is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the drink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the drink in kitchen 1, find and pick up the drink in living room 1, find and pick up the drink in bedroom 1
