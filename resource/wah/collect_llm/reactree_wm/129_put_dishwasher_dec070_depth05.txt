Your primary goal is to: move the cutlery fork on the dishwasher
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cutlery fork, and find the dishwasher and put down the cutlery fork.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cutlery fork
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the cutlery fork.
OK.
Act: recall location of cutlery fork
You saw cutlery fork 1 near kitchen cabinet 7 in kitchen 1. You saw cutlery fork 2 near cabinet 1 in bedroom 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cutlery fork in one of the rooms. The cutlery fork is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cutlery fork.
OK.
