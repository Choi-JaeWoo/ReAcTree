Your primary goal is to: move the juice drink in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the juice drink, and find the fridge and put down the juice drink.
Your task is to: find and pick up the juice drink
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the juice drink.
OK.
Act: recall location of juice
You have not seen juice before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the juice drink in one of the rooms. The juice drink is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the juice drink.
OK.
