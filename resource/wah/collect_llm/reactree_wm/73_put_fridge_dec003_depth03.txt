Your primary goal is to: Put 1 pancake, 1 wine, 1 cupcake, and 1 pudding in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move 1 pancake in the fridge, move 1 wine in the fridge, move 1 cupcake in the fridge, and and move 1 pudding in the fridge.
Your task is to: move 1 pancake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up 1 pancake, and find the fridge and put down 1 pancake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up 1 pancake, find the fridge and put down 1 pancake
