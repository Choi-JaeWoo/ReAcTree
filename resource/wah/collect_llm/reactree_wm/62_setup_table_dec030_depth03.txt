Your primary goal is to: Firstly, come to the drawer. You will find a cultlery fork that you are supposed to put on the table. Then take a water glass and put it next to the fork
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the drawer, move the cutlery fork on the table, and and move the water glass on the table.
Your task is to: and move the water glass on the table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water glass, and find the table and put down the water glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the water glass, find the table and put down the water glass
