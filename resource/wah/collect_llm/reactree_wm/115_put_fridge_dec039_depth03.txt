Your primary goal is to: get an apple
open the fridge door
put the apple in the fridge
get a pudding
put the pudding in the fridge
close the fridge door
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: get an apple, open the fridge door, put the apple in the fridge, get a pudding, put the pudding in the fridge, and close the fridge door.
Your task is to: get a pudding
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the pudding
OK.
Act: recall location of pudding
You have not seen pudding before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the pudding in one of the rooms. The pudding is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the pudding.
OK.
