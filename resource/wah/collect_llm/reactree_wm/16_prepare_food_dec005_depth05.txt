To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cup cake and pound cake, and find the kitchen table and put down the cup cake and pound cake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cup cake and pound cake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the cup cake and pound cake
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You have not seen cupcake before.
Act: recall location of pound cake
You have not seen pound cake before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cup cake and pound cake in one of the rooms. The cup cake and pound cake are more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cup cake and pound cake.
OK.
