Your primary goal is to: move the wine glass on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the wine glass, and find the kitchen table and put down the wine glass.
Your task is to: find and pick up the wine glass
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the wine glass
OK.
Act: recall location of wine glass
You have not seen wine glass before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the wine glass in one of the rooms. The wine glass is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the wine glass.
OK.
