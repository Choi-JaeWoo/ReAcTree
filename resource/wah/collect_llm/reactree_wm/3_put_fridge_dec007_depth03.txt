Your primary goal is to: put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and pancake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and pancake in living room 1, find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and and pancake in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cupcake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the cupcake
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You have not seen cupcake before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cupcake in one of the rooms. The cupcake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cupcake in living room 1, find and pick up the cupcake in bedroom 1
