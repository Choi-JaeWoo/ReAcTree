Your task is to: 1 plate, 1 cutlery fork, 1 wine glass and 1 water glass must go on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the plate on the kitchen table, move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the water glass on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the plate on the kitchen table, move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the water glass on the kitchen table
