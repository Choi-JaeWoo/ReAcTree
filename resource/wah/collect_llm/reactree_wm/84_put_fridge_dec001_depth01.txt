Your task is to: Please put an apple, a bottle of wine, a cupcake and a pudding in the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the apple in the fridge, move the bottle of wine in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, and move the pudding in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple in the fridge, move the bottle of wine in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, and move the pudding in the fridge
