Your primary goal is to: put 1 apple, 1 pancake , 1 cupcake and 1 jucie in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move 1 apple in the fridge, move 1 pancake in the fridge, move 1 cupcake in the fridge, and move 1 juice in the fridge.
Your task is to: move 1 pancake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pancake, and find the fridge and put down the pancake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pancake, find the fridge and put down the pancake
