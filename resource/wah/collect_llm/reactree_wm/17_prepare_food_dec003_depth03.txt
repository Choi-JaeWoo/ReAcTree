Your primary goal is to: Take one cupcake, one juice, one pound cake, one apple and one apple to the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and and move the apple on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the cupcake on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (3), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cupcake, and find the kitchen table and put down the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake, find the kitchen table and put down the cupcake
