Your primary goal is to: Put 1 plate, 1 wine glass, and 1 cutlery fork on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the plate on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and and move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the wine glass on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine glass, and find the kitchen table and put down the wine glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine glass, find the kitchen table and put down the wine glass
