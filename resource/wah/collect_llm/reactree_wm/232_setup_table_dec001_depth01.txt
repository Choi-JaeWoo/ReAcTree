Your task is to: Collect the fork and plate. Take both items to the kitchen table. Place fork and plate onto the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the fork, find and pick up the plate, and find the kitchen table and put down the fork and plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the fork, find and pick up the plate, find the kitchen table and put down the fork and plate
