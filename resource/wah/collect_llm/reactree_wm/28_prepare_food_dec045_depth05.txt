Your primary goal is to: move the cake on the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cake, and find the table and put down the cake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cake
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the cake
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You saw cupcake 1 near kitchen table 1 in kitchen 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cake in one of the rooms. The cake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cake.
OK.

- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the cake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cake in living room 1, find and pick up the cake in bedroom 1
