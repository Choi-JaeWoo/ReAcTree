Your task is to: Take one cupcake, one juice, one pound cake, one apple and one apple to the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (3), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table
