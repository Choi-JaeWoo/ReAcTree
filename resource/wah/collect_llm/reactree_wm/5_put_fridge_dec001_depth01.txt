Your task is to: Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
