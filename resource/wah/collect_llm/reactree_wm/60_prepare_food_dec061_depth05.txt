Your primary goal is to: move the cake on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cake, and find the kitchen table and put down the cake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the cake
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You have not seen cupcake before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cake in one of the rooms. The cake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the cake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cake in living room 1, find and pick up the cake in bedroom 1
