Your task is to: Go get the cup cake and pound cake out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table. Go get juice from the fridge and put it on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Go get the cup cake and pound cake out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table, go get juice from the fridge and put it on the kitchen table.
OK.
