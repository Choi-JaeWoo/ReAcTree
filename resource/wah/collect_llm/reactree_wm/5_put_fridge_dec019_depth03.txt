Your primary goal is to: Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, and take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge..
Your task is to: open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the apple, and find the fridge and put down the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find the fridge and put down the apple
