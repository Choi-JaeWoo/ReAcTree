Your primary goal is to: Prepare me a plate, a glass of wine and a glass of water for me at the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the plate on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, and and move the water on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: and move the water on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water, and find the kitchen table and put down the water.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the water, find the kitchen table and put down the water
