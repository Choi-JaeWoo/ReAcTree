Your task is to: Put pudding, pancake, coffee pot and juice on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, and move the juice on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, and move the juice on the kitchen table
