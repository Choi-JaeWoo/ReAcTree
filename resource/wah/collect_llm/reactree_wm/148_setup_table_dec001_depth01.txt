Your task is to: Put one wine glass and a plate on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the plate on the kitchen table
