Your primary goal is to: get a bottle of wine
open the fridge door
put the wine in the fridge
get a cupcake
put the cupcake in the fridge
get a juice
put the juice in the fridge
close the fridge door
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: get a bottle of wine, open the fridge door, put the wine in the fridge, get a cupcake, put the cupcake in the fridge, get a juice, put the juice in the fridge, and close the fridge door.
Your task is to: get a bottle of wine
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the wine.
OK.
Act: recall location of wine
You have not seen wine before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the wine in one of the rooms. The wine is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine in kitchen 1, find and pick up the wine in living room 1, find and pick up the wine in bedroom 1
