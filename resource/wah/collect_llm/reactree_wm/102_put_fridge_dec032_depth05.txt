Your primary goal is to: move the appli in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the appli, and find the fridge and put down the appli.
Your task is to: find and pick up the appli
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the appli.
OK.
Act: recall location of apple
You saw apple 2 near fridge 1 in kitchen 1. You saw apple 3 near cabinet 1 in living room 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the appli in one of the rooms. The appli is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the appli.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the appli in kitchen 1, find and pick up the appli in living room 1, find and pick up the appli in bedroom 1
