Your primary goal is to: Put 1 pancake, 1 wine, 1 apple, and 1 coffee pot on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the pancake on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pancake, and find the kitchen table and put down the pancake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pancake, find the kitchen table and put down the pancake
