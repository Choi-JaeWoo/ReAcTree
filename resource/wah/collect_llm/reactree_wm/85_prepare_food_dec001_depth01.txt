Your task is to: serve me a snack in the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the wine glass on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table
