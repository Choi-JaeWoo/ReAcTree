Your primary goal is to: and put a cleaning capsule in the cleaning capsule compartment. Shut the door and turn the dishwasher on by the on off button on the front.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: put a cleaning capsule in the cleaning capsule compartment, and shut the door and turn the dishwasher on by the on off button on the front.
Your task is to: put a cleaning capsule in the cleaning capsule compartment
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cleaning capsule, and find the cleaning capsule compartment and put down the cleaning capsule.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cleaning capsule, find the cleaning capsule compartment and put down the cleaning capsule
