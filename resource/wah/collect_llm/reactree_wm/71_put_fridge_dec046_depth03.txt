Your primary goal is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 pancake, 1 pound cake, and 1 apple in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move 1 cupcake in the fridge, move 1 pancake in the fridge, move 1 pound cake in the fridge, and and move 1 apple in the fridge.
Your task is to: move 1 pancake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pancake, and find the fridge and put down the pancake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pancake, find the fridge and put down the pancake
