Your task is to: Hey robot, please place the wine glass, the water glass, and plate to the dishwasher and turn it on to start the cycle.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), closet (3, 4), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and open the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, move the water glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, move the water glass in the dishwasher, close and turn on the dishwasher
