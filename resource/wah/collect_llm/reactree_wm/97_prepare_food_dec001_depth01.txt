Your task is to: Put the wine, cupcake, juice, pudding and pancake on the table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the wine on the table, move the cupcake on the table, move the juice on the table, move the pudding on the table, and move the pancake on the table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine on the table, move the cupcake on the table, move the juice on the table, move the pudding on the table, and move the pancake on the table
