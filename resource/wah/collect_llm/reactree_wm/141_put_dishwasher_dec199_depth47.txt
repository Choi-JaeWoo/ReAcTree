Your task is to: find the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: I need to find the dishwasher. I can see dishwasher 1.
OK.
