Your primary goal is to: Please put an apple, a pancake and some wine in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, and and move the wine in the fridge.
Your task is to: and move the wine in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine, and find the fridge and put down the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine, find the fridge and put down the wine
