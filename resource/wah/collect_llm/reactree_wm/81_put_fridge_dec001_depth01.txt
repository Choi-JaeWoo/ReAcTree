Your task is to: put 1 apple, 1 pancake , 1 cupcake and 1 jucie in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move 1 apple in the fridge, move 1 pancake in the fridge, move 1 cupcake in the fridge, move 1 juice in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move 1 apple in the fridge, move 1 pancake in the fridge, move 1 cupcake in the fridge, move 1 juice in the fridge
