Your primary goal is to: move the pound cake on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the pound cake, and find the kitchen table and put down the pound cake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the pound cake
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the pound cake
OK.
Act: recall location of pound cake
You saw pound cake 1 near coffee table 1 in living room 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the pound cake in one of the rooms. The pound cake is more likely to appear in living room 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the pound cake.
OK.
