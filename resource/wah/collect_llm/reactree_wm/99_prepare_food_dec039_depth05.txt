Your primary goal is to: find all of: 1 wine
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find the wine in kitchen 1, find the wine in living room 1, and find the wine in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: find the wine in bedroom 1
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: I am in living room 1. Now, I need to go to bedroom 1.
OK.
Act: go to bedroom 1
You move to the bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: Now, I need to find the wine. The wine is more likely to appear on nightstand (2), or in cabinet (1), closet (2). I can check each place one by one, starting from nightstand 2, until I find the wine.
OK.
Act: go to nightstand 2
You arrive at the nightstand (2). The nightstand (2) is closed. You see bed (1), light switch (3), nightstand (2)

You open nightstand. You see bed (1), light switch (3), nightstand (2)
