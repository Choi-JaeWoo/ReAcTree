Your task is to: Please put a bottle of wine, a cupcake, the pudding, one apple and the coffee pot on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the wine bottle on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine bottle on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table
