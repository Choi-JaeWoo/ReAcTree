Your primary goal is to: go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the pudding and apple, and find the kitchen table and put down the pudding and apple.
Your task is to: find and pick up the pudding and apple
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the pudding and apple.
OK.
Act: recall location of pudding
You saw pudding 1 near kitchen cabinet 8 in kitchen 1. You saw pudding 2 near cabinet 1 in bedroom 1. You saw pudding 3 near cabinet 1 in bedroom 1.
Act: recall location of apple
You saw apple 1 near kitchen table 1 in kitchen 1. You saw apple 2 near kitchen cabinet 8 in kitchen 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the pudding and apple in one of the rooms. The pudding and apple are more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, bedroom 1, or bedroom 2. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the pudding and apple.
OK.
