Your task is to: Hello robot, please gather 1 wine bottle, 1 cupcake, 1 juice container, 1 pudding cup, and 1 pancake from their respective locations and place them on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the wine bottle on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice container on the kitchen table, move the pudding cup on the kitchen table, and move the pancake on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine bottle on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice container on the kitchen table, move the pudding cup on the kitchen table, and move the pancake on the kitchen table
