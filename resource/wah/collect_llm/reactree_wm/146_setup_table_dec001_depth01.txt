Your task is to: can you serve on the table: 1 cutlery fork, 1 wine glass, and 1 plate, please?
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the plate on the kitchen table
