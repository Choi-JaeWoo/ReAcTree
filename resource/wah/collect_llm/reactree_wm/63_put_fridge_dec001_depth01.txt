Your task is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, 1 pancake, 1 pound cake, and 1 apple in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move 1 cupcake in the fridge, move 1 juice in the fridge, move 1 pancake in the fridge, move 1 pound cake in the fridge, and move 1 apple in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move 1 cupcake in the fridge, move 1 juice in the fridge, move 1 pancake in the fridge, move 1 pound cake in the fridge, and move 1 apple in the fridge
