Your primary goal is to: I need you to store the following food items in the fridge:
- 1 pudding
- 1 wine
- 1 apple
- 1 juice
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: store the pudding in the fridge, store the wine in the fridge, store the apple in the fridge, and and store the juice in the fridge.
Your task is to: and store the juice in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the juice, and find the fridge and put down the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice, find the fridge and put down the juice
