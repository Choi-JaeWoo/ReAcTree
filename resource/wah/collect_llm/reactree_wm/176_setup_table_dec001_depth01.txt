Your task is to: Bring 1 fork 1 wine glass 1 glass of water and 1 plate and put them on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the water glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the water glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table
