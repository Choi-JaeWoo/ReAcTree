Your primary goal is to: Put an apple on the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the apple, and find the coffee table and put down the apple.
Your task is to: find and pick up the apple
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the apple.
OK.
Act: recall location of apple
You have not seen apple before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the apple in one of the rooms. The apple is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, bedroom 1, or bedroom 2. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the apple.
OK.
