Your primary goal is to: move the wine on the coffee table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the wine, and find the coffee table and put down the wine.
Your task is to: find and pick up the wine
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the wine.
OK.
Act: recall location of wine
You saw wine 2 near kitchen table 1 in kitchen 1. You saw wine 1 near fridge 1 in kitchen 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the wine in one of the rooms. The wine is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the wine.
OK.
