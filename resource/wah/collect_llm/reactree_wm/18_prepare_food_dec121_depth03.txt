Your primary goal is to: Hello robot, please gather 1 wine bottle, 1 cupcake, 1 juice container, 1 pudding cup, and 1 pancake from their respective locations and place them on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the wine bottle on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice container on the kitchen table, move the pudding cup on the kitchen table, and and move the pancake on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: and move the pancake on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pancake, and find the kitchen table and put down the pancake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pancake, find the kitchen table and put down the pancake
