Your primary goal is to: store the pancake, the glass of wine, the cupcake and the glass of juice in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: store the pancake in the fridge, store the glass of wine in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, and store the glass of juice in the fridge.
Your task is to: store the pancake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the pancake
OK.
Act: recall location of pancake
You have not seen pancake before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the pancake in one of the rooms. The pancake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the pancake.
OK.
