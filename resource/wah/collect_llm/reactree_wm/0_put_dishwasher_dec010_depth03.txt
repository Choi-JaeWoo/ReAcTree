Your primary goal is to: Collect in the dishwasher the silverware, the plate and glass before turning it on
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the dishwasher, move the silverware in the dishwasher, move the plate in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
Your task is to: move the silverware in the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the silverware, and find the dishwasher and put down the silverware.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the silverware, find the dishwasher and put down the silverware
