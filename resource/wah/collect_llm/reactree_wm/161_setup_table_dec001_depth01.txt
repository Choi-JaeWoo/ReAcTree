Your task is to: leave the cutlery fork and the water glass on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, and move the water glass on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the water glass on the kitchen table
