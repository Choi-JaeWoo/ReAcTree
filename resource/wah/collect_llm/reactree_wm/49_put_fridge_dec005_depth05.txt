Your task is to: find and remember the location of 1 pudding
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the pudding.
OK.
Act: recall location of pudding
You have not seen pudding before.
Think: Now, I need to find and remember the location of the pudding in one of the rooms. The pudding is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and remember the location of the pudding.
OK.
