Your primary goal is to: Please bring me a coffee pot as well as a juice and an apple to the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, and and move the apple on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the juice on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the juice, and find the kitchen table and put down the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice, find the kitchen table and put down the juice
