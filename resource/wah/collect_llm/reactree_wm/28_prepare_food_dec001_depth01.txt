Your task is to: Put the cupcake, juice, cake, pancake and coffee on the table.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake on the table, move the juice on the table, move the cake on the table, move the pancake on the table, move the coffee on the table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake on the table, move the juice on the table, move the cake on the table, move the pancake on the table, move the coffee on the table
