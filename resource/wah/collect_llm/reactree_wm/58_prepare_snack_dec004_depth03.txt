Your primary goal is to: Go to the kitchen and collect the following items from the kitchen table and carry them to the coffee table in the lounge:1 pudding, 1 bottle of wine, 1 apple and 1 juice drink.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: go to the kitchen, collect the following items from the kitchen table and carry them to the coffee table in the lounge:1 pudding, 1 bottle of wine, and 1 apple and 1 juice drink.
Your task is to: collect the following items from the kitchen table and carry them to the coffee table in the lounge:1 pudding
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pudding, and find the coffee table and put down the pudding.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pudding, find the coffee table and put down the pudding
