Your task is to: Put 1 juice, 1 poundcake, and 1 pudding in the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move 1 juice in the fridge, move 1 poundcake in the fridge, and move 1 pudding in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move 1 juice in the fridge, move 1 poundcake in the fridge, and move 1 pudding in the fridge
