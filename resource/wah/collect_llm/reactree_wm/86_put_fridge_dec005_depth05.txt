Your primary goal is to: store the pudding in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the pudding, and find the fridge and put down the pudding.
Your task is to: find and pick up the pudding
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the pudding.
OK.
Act: recall location of pudding
You have not seen pudding before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the pudding in one of the rooms. The pudding is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the pudding.
OK.
