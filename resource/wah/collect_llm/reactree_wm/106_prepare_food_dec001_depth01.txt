Your task is to: Put the coffee pot and a pancake and a wine and a 1 pound cake on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the 1 pound cake on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the 1 pound cake on the kitchen table
