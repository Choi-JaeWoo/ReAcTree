Your task is to: take one fork, one wine glass, one water glass, and one plate, and place them on the table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the table, move the wine glass on the table, move the water glass on the table, and move the plate on the table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cutlery fork on the table, move the wine glass on the table, move the water glass on the table, and move the plate on the table
