Your primary goal is to: Hey robot, please place the wine glass, the water glass, and plate to the dishwasher and turn it on to start the cycle.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, move the water glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
Your task is to: move the water glass in the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water glass, and find the dishwasher and put down the water glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the water glass, find the dishwasher and put down the water glass
