Your primary goal is to: Put 1 plate and 1 wine glass on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the plate on the kitchen table, and move the wine glass on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the plate on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the plate, and find the kitchen table and put down the plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the plate, find the kitchen table and put down the plate
