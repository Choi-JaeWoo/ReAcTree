Your task is to: Go the fridge and get a pudding.  Put it on the coffee table.  go to the fruit bowl and collect an apple and place it on the coffee table.  Go to the fridge and get a juice and place on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals sequentially. Go the fridge and get a pudding, put it on the coffee table, go to the fruit bowl and collect an apple and place it on the coffee table, and go to the fridge and get a juice and place on the coffee table.
OK.
