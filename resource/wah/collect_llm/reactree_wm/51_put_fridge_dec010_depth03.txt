Your primary goal is to: Put 1 wine, 1 juice, 1 pudding, 1 apple and 1 pancake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the fridge, move the wine in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and and move the pancake in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the wine in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine, and find the fridge and put down the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine, find the fridge and put down the wine
