Your task is to: Hello "robot name". Please give me: one apple, one pancake, one pound cake and one juice. Put them all on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the apple on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table
