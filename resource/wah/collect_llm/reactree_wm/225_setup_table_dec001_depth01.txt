You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine glass, and find and pick up the plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine glass, find and pick up the plate
