Your task is to: get a bottle of wine
put it on the kitchen table
get a water glass
put it on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Get a bottle of wine and put it on the kitchen table, and get a water glass and put it on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: get a bottle of wine and put it on the kitchen table, get a water glass and put it on the kitchen table
