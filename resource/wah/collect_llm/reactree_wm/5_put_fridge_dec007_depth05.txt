Your primary goal is to: Take an apple from the basket
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the apple in kitchen 1, find and pick up the apple in living room 1, and find and pick up the apple in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: find and pick up the apple in kitchen 1
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: I am in kitchen 1. Now, I need to find the apple. The apple is more likely to appear on kitchen table (1), or in fridge (1), kitchen counter (1). I can check each place one by one, starting from kitchen table 1, until I find the apple.
OK.
Act: go to kitchen table 1
You arrive at the kitchen table (1). You see apple (1), bench (1, 2), chips (1), condiment shaker (1), cupcake (1), cutlery fork (1, 2), cutlery knife (1, 2), juice (1, 2), kitchen table (1), light switch (3), mug (2), plate (2, 3), salad (1), water glass (2, 3), wine (1)
Think: I find apple 1. Now, I need to pick it up.
OK.
Act: pick up apple 1
You pick up apple. You hold apple (1).
Think: Now I accomplish the goal.
OK.
Act: done
