Your primary goal is to: move the glasses in the dishwasher
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the glasses, and find the dishwasher and put down the glasses.
Your task is to: find and pick up the glasses
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the glasses.
OK.
Act: recall location of glasses
You have not seen glasses before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the glasses in one of the rooms. The glasses is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the glasses.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the glasses in kitchen 1, find and pick up the glasses in living room 1, find and pick up the glasses in bedroom 1
