Your task is to: Please put a pudding, a glasse of wine, a cupcake and a glass of juice on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the coffee table, move the wine glass on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and move the juice glass on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the wine glass on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and move the juice glass on the coffee table
