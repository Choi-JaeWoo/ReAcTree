Your primary goal is to: move the plat in the dishwasher
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the plat, and find the dishwasher and put down the plat.
Your task is to: find and pick up the plat
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the plat.
OK.
Act: recall location of plate
You have not seen plate before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the plat in one of the rooms. The plat is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the plat.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the plat in kitchen 1, find and pick up the plat in living room 1, find and pick up the plat in bedroom 1
