Your task is to: Please store the cupcake and pudding in the fridge, Robot.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake in the fridge, and move the pudding in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge
