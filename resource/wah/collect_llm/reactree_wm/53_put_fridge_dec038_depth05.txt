Your primary goal is to: move the items in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice drink in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and and move the pancake in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the juice drink in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the juice drink, and find the fridge and put down the juice drink.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice drink, find the fridge and put down the juice drink
