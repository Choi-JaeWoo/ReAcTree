Your primary goal is to: Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, and take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge..
Your task is to: Take an apple from the basket
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the apple.
OK.
Act: recall location of apple
You have not seen apple before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the apple in one of the rooms. The apple is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the apple.
OK.
