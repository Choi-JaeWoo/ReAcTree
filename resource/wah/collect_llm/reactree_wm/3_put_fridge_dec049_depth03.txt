Your primary goal is to: put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and pancake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and pancake in living room 1, find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and and pancake in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: juice
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the juice
OK.
Act: recall location of juice
You have not seen juice before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the juice in one of the rooms. The juice is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice in kitchen 1, find and pick up the juice in living room 1, find and pick up the juice in bedroom 1
