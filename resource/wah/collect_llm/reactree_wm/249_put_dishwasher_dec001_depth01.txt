Your task is to: Place the fork, the wine glass and the plate into the dishwasher and close the door. Then turn the dishwasher on.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher
