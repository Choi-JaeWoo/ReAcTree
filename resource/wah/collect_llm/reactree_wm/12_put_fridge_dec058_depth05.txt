Your primary goal is to: move the cupcake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cupcake, and find the fridge and put down the cupcake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cupcake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the cupcake
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You saw cupcake 2 near kitchen cabinet 8 in kitchen 1. You saw cupcake 1 near kitchen cabinet 8 in kitchen 1. You saw cupcake 3 near cabinet 1 in bedroom 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cupcake in one of the rooms. The cupcake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cupcake.
OK.
