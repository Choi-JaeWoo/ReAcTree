Your primary goal is to: move the cup cake on the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cup cake, and find the table and put down the cup cake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cup cake
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (5), chair (2), desk (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the cup cake
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You saw cupcake 1 near kitchen cabinet 6 in kitchen 1. You saw cupcake 2 near kitchen cabinet 7 in kitchen 1.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cupcake in one of the rooms. The cupcake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cupcake.
OK.
