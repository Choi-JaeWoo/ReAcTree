Your primary goal is to: Go get the cup cake and pound cake out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table. Go get juice from the fridge and put it on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: go get the cup cake and pound cake out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table, and go get juice from the fridge and put it on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pudding and apple, and find the kitchen table and put down the pudding and apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pudding and apple, find the kitchen table and put down the pudding and apple
