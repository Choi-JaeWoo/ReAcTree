Your task is to: put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of cupcake, juice, and pancake
OK.
Act: recall location of cupcake
You have not seen cupcake before.
Act: recall location of juice
You have not seen juice before.
Act: recall location of pancake

Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and pancake in one of the rooms. The cupcake, juice, and pancake are more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and pancake.
OK.
