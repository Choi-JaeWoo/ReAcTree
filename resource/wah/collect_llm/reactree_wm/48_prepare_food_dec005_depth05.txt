Your primary goal is to: move the wine bottle on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the wine bottle, and find the kitchen table and put down the wine bottle.
Your task is to: find and pick up the wine bottle
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the wine bottle.
OK.
Act: recall location of wine
You have not seen wine before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the wine bottle in one of the rooms. The wine bottle is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the wine bottle.
OK.
