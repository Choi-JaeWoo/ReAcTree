Your primary goal is to: Put 1 juice, 1 poundcake, and 1 pudding in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move 1 juice in the fridge, move 1 poundcake in the fridge, and and move 1 pudding in the fridge.
Your task is to: move 1 juice in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up 1 juice, and find the fridge and put down 1 juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up 1 juice, find the fridge and put down 1 juice
