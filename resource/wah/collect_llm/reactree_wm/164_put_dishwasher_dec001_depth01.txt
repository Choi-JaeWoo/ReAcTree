Your task is to: Please get the dirty fork and the two glasses and put them all in the dishwasher and turn it on.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher
