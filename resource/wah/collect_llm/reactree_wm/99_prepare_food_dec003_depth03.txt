Your primary goal is to: 1. find all of: 1 wine, 1 cupcake, 1 pound cake, 1 apple, and 1 coffee pot and remember their location.
2. remove all that are already on the kitchen table
3. grab as much as you can hold by going to remembered locations
4. go to kitchen table deposit at the table.
5. if any elements aren't yet on the table go to step 3.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find all of: 1 wine, 1 cupcake, 1 pound cake, 1 apple, and 1 coffee pot and remember their location, remove all that are already on the kitchen table, grab as much as you can hold by going to remembered locations, go to kitchen table deposit at the table, and if any elements aren't yet on the table go to step 3.
Your task is to: find all of: 1 wine
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the wine.
OK.
Act: recall location of wine
You have not seen wine before.
Think: Now, I need to find the wine in one of the rooms. The wine is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find the wine in kitchen 1, find the wine in living room 1, find the wine in bedroom 1
