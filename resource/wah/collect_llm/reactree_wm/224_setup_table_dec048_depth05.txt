Your primary goal is to: and move the water on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the water, and find the kitchen table and put down the water.
Your task is to: find and pick up the water
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the water.
OK.
Act: recall location of water glass
You have not seen water glass before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the water in one of the rooms. The water is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the water.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the water in kitchen 1, find and pick up the water in living room 1, find and pick up the water in bedroom 1
