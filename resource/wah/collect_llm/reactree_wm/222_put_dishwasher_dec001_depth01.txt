Your task is to: Robot, please load the wine glass, water glass, and plate into the dishwasher and turn it on.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Load the wine glass into the dishwasher, load the water glass into the dishwasher, and load the plate into the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: load the wine glass into the dishwasher, load the water glass into the dishwasher, and load the plate into the dishwasher
