Your task is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 pancake, 1 wine, and 1 pudding on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, and move the pudding on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, and move the pudding on the kitchen table
