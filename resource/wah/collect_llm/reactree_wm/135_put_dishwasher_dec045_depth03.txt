Your primary goal is to: wash the cutlery fork,  wine glass,  water glass, and plate that are in the dishwasher
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: wash the cutlery fork, wash the wine glass, wash the water glass, and and wash the plate.
Your task is to: wash the water glass
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water glass, and find the dishwasher and put down the water glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the water glass, find the dishwasher and put down the water glass
