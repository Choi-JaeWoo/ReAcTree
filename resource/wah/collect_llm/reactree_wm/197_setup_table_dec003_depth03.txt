Your primary goal is to: Please put out a fork, a water glass and a plate ready on the kitchen table for me.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the water glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cutlery fork, and find the kitchen table and put down the cutlery fork.
OK.
