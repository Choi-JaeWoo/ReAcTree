Your primary goal is to: move the plate on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the plate, and find the kitchen table and put down the plate.
Your task is to: find and pick up the plate
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the plate
OK.
Act: recall location of plate
You have not seen plate before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the plate in one of the rooms. The plate is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the plate in kitchen 1, find and pick up the plate in living room 1, find and pick up the plate in bedroom 1
