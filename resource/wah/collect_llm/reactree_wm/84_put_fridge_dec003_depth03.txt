Your primary goal is to: Please put an apple, a bottle of wine, a cupcake and a pudding in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the apple in the fridge, move the bottle of wine in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, and and move the pudding in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the apple in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the apple, and find the fridge and put down the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find the fridge and put down the apple
