Your task is to: Collect one apple and one cupcake and place it on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the cupcake on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table
