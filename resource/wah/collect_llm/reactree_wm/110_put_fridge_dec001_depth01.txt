Your task is to: Please put an apple, a pancake and some wine in the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, and move the wine in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, and move the wine in the fridge
