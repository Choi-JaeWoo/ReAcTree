Your primary goal is to: move the glass of water in the dishwasher
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the glass of water, and find the dishwasher and put down the glass of water.
Your task is to: find and pick up the glass of water
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to recall the location of the glass of water.
OK.
Act: recall location of glasses
You have not seen glasses before.
Think: Now, I need to find and pick up the glass of water in one of the rooms. The glass of water is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, bedroom 1, or bedroom 2. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the glass of water.
OK.
