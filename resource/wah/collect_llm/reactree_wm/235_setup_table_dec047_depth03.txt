Your primary goal is to: Get the wine glass and water glass out of the cupboard and put them on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: get the wine glass out of the cupboard, and get the water glass out of the cupboard.
Your task is to: get the water glass out of the cupboard
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2, 3), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water glass, and find the kitchen table and put down the water glass.
OK.
