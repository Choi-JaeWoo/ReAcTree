Your task is to: get a coffee pot
put it on the kitchen table
get a wine
put it on the kitchen table
get a pound cake
put it on the kitchen table
get a cupcake
put it on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, and move the cupcake on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, and move the cupcake on the kitchen table
