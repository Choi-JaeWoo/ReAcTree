Your primary goal is to: move the 1 pound cake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the 1 pound cake, and find the fridge and put down the 1 pound cake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the 1 pound cake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), closet (3, 4), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the 1 pound cake in one of the rooms. The 1 pound cake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the 1 pound cake.
OK.
