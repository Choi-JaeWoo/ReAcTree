Your primary goal is to: Take the dirty cutlery fork, wine glass and a plate from the table and put them into the dishwasher and turn it on.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and and close and turn on the dishwasher.
Your task is to: move the wine glass in the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine glass, and find the dishwasher and put down the wine glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine glass, find the dishwasher and put down the wine glass
