Your task is to: Home service robot, please put 1 wine, 1 cupcake, 1 juice, 1 apple and 1 pound cake into the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the wine in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge
