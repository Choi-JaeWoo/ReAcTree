Your task is to: Grab the cupcake, juice, 1 pound cake, pudding and pancake from the table and put them into the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the 1 pound cake in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, and move the pancake in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the 1 pound cake in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, and move the pancake in the fridge
