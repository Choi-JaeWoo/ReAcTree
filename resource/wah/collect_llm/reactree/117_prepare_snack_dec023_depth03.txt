Your primary goal is to: Please put a pudding, a glasse of wine, a cupcake and a glass of juice on the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the wine glass on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and and move the juice glass on the coffee table.
Your task is to: move the wine glass on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine glass, and find the coffee table and put down the wine glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine glass, find the coffee table and put down the wine glass
