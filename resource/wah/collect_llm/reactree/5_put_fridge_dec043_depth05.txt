Your primary goal is to: take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice, and find the fridge and put down the 1 pound cake and 1 juice.
Your task is to: find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice in one of the rooms. The 1 pound cake and 1 juice are more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice.
OK.
