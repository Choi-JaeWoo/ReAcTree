Your primary goal is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 pudding, and 1 apple on the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cupcake on the coffee table, move the pudding on the coffee table, and move the apple on the coffee table.
Your task is to: move the cupcake on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cupcake, and find the coffee table and put down the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake, find the coffee table and put down the cupcake
