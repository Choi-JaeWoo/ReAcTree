Your primary goal is to: and 1 plate and remember their location
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and remember the location of 1 cutlery fork, find and remember the location of 1 water glass, and and find and remember the location of 1 plate.
Your task is to: find and remember the location of 1 cutlery fork
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and remember the location of 1 cutlery fork in one of the rooms. The cutlery fork is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and remember the location of 1 cutlery fork.
OK.
