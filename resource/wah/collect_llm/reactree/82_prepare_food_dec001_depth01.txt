Your task is to: please serve on the table: 1 cup of coffee, 1 glass of wine, 1 glass of juice and 1 pancake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the coffee cup on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the juice glass on the kitchen table, and move the pancake on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the coffee cup on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the juice glass on the kitchen table, and move the pancake on the kitchen table
