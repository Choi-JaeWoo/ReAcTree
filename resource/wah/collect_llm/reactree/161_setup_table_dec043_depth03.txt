Your primary goal is to: leave the cutlery fork and the water glass on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, and move the water glass on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the water glass on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (5), chair (2), desk (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water glass, and find the kitchen table and put down the water glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the water glass, find the kitchen table and put down the water glass
