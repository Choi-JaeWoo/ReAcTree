Your primary goal is to: move the poundcake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the poundcake, and find the fridge and put down the poundcake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the poundcake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the poundcake in one of the rooms. The poundcake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the poundcake.
OK.
