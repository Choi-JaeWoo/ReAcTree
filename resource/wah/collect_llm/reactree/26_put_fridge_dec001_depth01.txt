Your task is to: store the pancake, the glass of wine, the cupcake and the glass of juice in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Store the pancake in the fridge, store the glass of wine in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, store the glass of juice in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: store the pancake in the fridge, store the glass of wine in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, store the glass of juice in the fridge
