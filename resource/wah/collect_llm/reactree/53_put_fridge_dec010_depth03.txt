To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the fridge, and move the items in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the items in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 6 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cupcake, find and pick up the juice drink, find and pick up the pound cake, find and pick up the pudding, find and pick up the apple, and find and pick up the pancake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake, find and pick up the juice drink, find and pick up the pound cake, find and pick up the pudding, find and pick up the apple, and find and pick up the pancake
