Your primary goal is to: pick up an apple
put apple on the coffee table
pick up cupcake 
put cupcake on the coffee table
pick up pudding dish
set dish onto the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the apple, move the apple on the coffee table, and find and pick up the cupcake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cupcake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the cupcake in one of the rooms. The cupcake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cupcake in living room 1, find and pick up the cupcake in bedroom 1
