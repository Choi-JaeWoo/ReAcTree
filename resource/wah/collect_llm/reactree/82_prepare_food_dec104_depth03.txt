Your primary goal is to: please serve on the table: 1 cup of coffee, 1 glass of wine, 1 glass of juice and 1 pancake
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the coffee cup on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the juice glass on the kitchen table, and and move the pancake on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: and move the pancake on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pancake, and find the kitchen table and put down the pancake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pancake, find the kitchen table and put down the pancake
