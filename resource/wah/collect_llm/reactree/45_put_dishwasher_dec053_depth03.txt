Your primary goal is to: Open the dishwasher. Place a wine glass and a water glass in the dishwasher and turn the dishwasher on
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: open the dishwasher, place a wine glass in the dishwasher, and place a water glass in the dishwasher.
Your task is to: place a water glass in the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water glass, and find the dishwasher and put down the water glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the water glass, find the dishwasher and put down the water glass
