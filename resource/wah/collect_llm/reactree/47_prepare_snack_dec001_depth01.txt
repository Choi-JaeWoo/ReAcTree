Your task is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 wine, and 1 apple on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake on the coffee table, move the wine on the coffee table, and move the apple on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake on the coffee table, move the wine on the coffee table, move the apple on the coffee table
