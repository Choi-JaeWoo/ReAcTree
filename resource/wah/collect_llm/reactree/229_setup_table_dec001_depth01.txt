Your task is to: Need one cutlery fork, one glass of wine and one glass of water on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the water glass on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the water glass on the kitchen table
