Your primary goal is to: move 1 pancake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up 1 pancake, and find the fridge and put down 1 pancake.
Your task is to: find and pick up 1 pancake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up 1 pancake in one of the rooms. The pancake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up 1 pancake.
OK.
