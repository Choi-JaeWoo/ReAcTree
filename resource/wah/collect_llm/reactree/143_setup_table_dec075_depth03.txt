Your primary goal is to: take one fork, one wine glass, one water glass, and one plate, and place them on the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cutlery fork on the table, move the wine glass on the table, move the water glass on the table, and and move the plate on the table.
Your task is to: move the water glass on the table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (5), chair (2), desk (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the water glass, and find the table and put down the water glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the water glass, find the table and put down the water glass
