Your task is to: Go to the kitchen and collect the following items from the kitchen table and carry them to the coffee table in the lounge:1 pudding, 1 bottle of wine, 1 apple and 1 juice drink.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the coffee table, move the wine on the coffee table, move the apple on the coffee table, move the juice drink on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the wine on the coffee table, move the apple on the coffee table, move the juice drink on the coffee table
