Your primary goal is to: Please put a bottle of wine, a cupcake and a pudding in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the wine in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, and and move the pudding in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the wine in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine, and find the fridge and put down the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine, find the fridge and put down the wine
