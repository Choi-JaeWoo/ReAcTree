Your primary goal is to: Put 1 juice, 1 pudding, and 1 apple on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the juice on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the juice, and find the kitchen table and put down the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice, find the kitchen table and put down the juice
