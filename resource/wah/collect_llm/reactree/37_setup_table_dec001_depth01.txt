Your task is to: Go into the kitchen. Go to the kitchen table and move it 1 cutlery fork, 1 wine glass, and 1 plate on the dining table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), closet (3, 4), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the dining table, and move the wine glass on the dining table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cutlery fork on the dining table, move the wine glass on the dining table
