Your task is to: Robot get 1 cupcake, 1 juice, 1 pound cake, 1 pudding and 1 coffee pot and put them in the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table
