Your task is to: locate 1 green apple, 1 pancake, 1 pound cake, and 1 grapefruit juice on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and pick up the green apple, find and pick up the pancake, find and pick up the pound cake, find and pick up the grapefruit juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and pick up the green apple, find and pick up the pancake, find and pick up the pound cake, find and pick up the grapefruit juice
