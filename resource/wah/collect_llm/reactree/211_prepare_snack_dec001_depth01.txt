Your task is to: Get a cupcake and a pudding and put them on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake on the coffee table, move the pudding on the coffee table, and move the wine on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake on the coffee table, move the pudding on the coffee table, and move the wine on the coffee table
