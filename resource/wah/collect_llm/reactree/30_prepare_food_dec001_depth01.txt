Your task is to: Please bring me a coffee pot as well as a juice and an apple to the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table
