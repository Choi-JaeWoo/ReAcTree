Your primary goal is to: Go get the cup cake and pound cake out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table. Go get juice from the fridge and put it on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: go get the cup cake and pound cake out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table, and and go get juice from the fridge and put it on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: go get pudding and an apple out of the fridge and put them on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Go get pudding out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, and go get an apple out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: go get pudding out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table, go get an apple out of the fridge and put it on the kitchen table
