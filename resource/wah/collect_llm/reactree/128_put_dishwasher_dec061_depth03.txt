Your primary goal is to: Put glasses and plate into the dishwasher and turn it on.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the dishwasher, move the glasses in the dishwasher, move the plate in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
Your task is to: move the plate in the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1). You hold water glass (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the plate, and find the dishwasher and put down the plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the plate, find the dishwasher and put down the plate
