Your task is to: put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge. The cupcake, juice, and pancake are more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cupcake, juice, and pancake.
OK.
