Your primary goal is to: bring a pudding, a pound cake, a cup cake and a glass of juice and put them on the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the pudding on the table, move the pound cake on the table, move the cup cake on the table, and and move the glass of juice on the table.
Your task is to: and move the glass of juice on the table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (5), chair (2), desk (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the glass of juice, and find the table and put down the glass of juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the glass of juice, find the table and put down the glass of juice
