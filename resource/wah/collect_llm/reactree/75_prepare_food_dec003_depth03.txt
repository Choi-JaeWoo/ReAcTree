Your primary goal is to: carry 1 coffee pot, 1 wine,1 cupcake and 1 pudding on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the coffee pot on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, and and move the pudding on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the coffee pot on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the coffee pot, and find the kitchen table and put down the coffee pot.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the coffee pot, find the kitchen table and put down the coffee pot
