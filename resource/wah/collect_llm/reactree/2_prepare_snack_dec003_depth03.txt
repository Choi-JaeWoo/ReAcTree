Your primary goal is to: Collect one apple and one cupcake and place it on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the apple, and find and pick up the cupcake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the apple
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the apple in one of the rooms. The apple is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple in kitchen 1, find and pick up the apple in living room 1, find and pick up the apple in bedroom 1
