Your task is to: Robot, please pick up the fork, wine glass, and plate from the kitchen counter and place them on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table
