Your primary goal is to: move the coffee on the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the coffee, and find the table and put down the coffee.
Your task is to: find and pick up the coffee
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (5), chair (2), desk (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the coffee in one of the rooms. The coffee is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, bedroom 1, or bedroom 2. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the coffee.
OK.

- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the coffee in kitchen 1, find and pick up the coffee in living room 1, find and pick up the coffee in bedroom 1, find and pick up the coffee in bedroom 2
