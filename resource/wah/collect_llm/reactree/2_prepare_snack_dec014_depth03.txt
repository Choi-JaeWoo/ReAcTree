Your primary goal is to: Collect one apple and one cupcake and place it on the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the apple, and find and pick up the cupcake.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cupcake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1). You hold apple (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the cupcake in one of the rooms. The cupcake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cupcake in living room 1, find and pick up the cupcake in bedroom 1
