Your primary goal is to: Please, but 1 cupcake, 1 pound cake, 1 apple, 1 pancake, and 1 coffee pot  on the kitchen table one by one.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, and and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table.
Your task is to: move the cupcake on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cupcake, and find the kitchen table and put down the cupcake.
OK.
