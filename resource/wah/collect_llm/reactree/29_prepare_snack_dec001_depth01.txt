Your task is to: Go put the pudding, juice, cupcake and apple on the  table 
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the table, move the juice on the table, move the cupcake on the table, and move the apple on the table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the table, move the juice on the table, move the cupcake on the table, and move the apple on the table
