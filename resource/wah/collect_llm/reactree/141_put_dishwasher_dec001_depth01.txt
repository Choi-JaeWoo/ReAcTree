Your task is to: 1. find all of: 1 cutlery fork, 1 water glass, and 1 plate and remember their location.
2. remove all that are already in the dishwasher.
3. grab as much as you can hold by going to remembered locations
4. go to the dishwasher.
5. open it.
6. put what you are holding into it.
7. close it
8. if any elements aren't yet in the dishwasher go to step 3.
9. press the start button on the dishwasher.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see chair (1), closet (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 9 subgoals sequentially. Find all of: 1 cutlery fork, 1 water glass, and 1 plate and remember their location, remove all that are already in the dishwasher, grab as much as you can hold by going to remembered locations, go to the dishwasher, open it, put what you are holding into it, close it, if any elements aren't yet in the dishwasher go to step 3, press the start button on the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find all of: 1 cutlery fork, 1 water glass, and 1 plate and remember their location, remove all that are already in the dishwasher, grab as much as you can hold by going to remembered locations, go to the dishwasher, open it, put what you are holding into it, close it, if any elements aren't yet in the dishwasher go to step 3, press the start button on the dishwasher
