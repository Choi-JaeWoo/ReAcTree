Your primary goal is to: open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: open the door and put the apple into there, and come back.
Your task is to: open the door and put the apple into there
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and open the door, and find the apple and put it into there.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and open the door, find the apple and put it into there
