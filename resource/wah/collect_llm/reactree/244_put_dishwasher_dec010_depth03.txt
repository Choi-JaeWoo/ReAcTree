Your primary goal is to: Please put the fork and the wine and water glasses I left out, into the washer and press run?
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the washer, move the fork in the washer, move the wine glass in the washer, and close and turn on the washer.
Your task is to: move the fork in the washer
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the fork, and find the washer and put down the fork.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the fork, find the washer and put down the fork
