Your task is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 pancake, 1 pound cake, 1 pudding, 1 apple, and 1 coffee pot on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 6 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the pound cake on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table
