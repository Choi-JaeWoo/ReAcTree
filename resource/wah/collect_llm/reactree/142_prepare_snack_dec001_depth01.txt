Your task is to: Bring me 1 apple and 1 pudding and put them on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Find and pick up the apple, find and pick up the pudding, and find the coffee table and put down the apple and pudding.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find and pick up the pudding, find the coffee table and put down the apple and pudding
