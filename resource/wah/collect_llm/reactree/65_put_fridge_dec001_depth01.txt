Your task is to: Please put 1 apple, 1 pancake, 1 pound cake and 1 juice in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge
