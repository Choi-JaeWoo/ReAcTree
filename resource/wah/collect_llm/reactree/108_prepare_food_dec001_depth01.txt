Your task is to: Robot, get me 1 bottle of wine, 1 cupcake, 1 juice, 1 pudding and 1 apple and put them in the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Move the wine on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, move the juice on the kitchen table, move the pudding on the kitchen table, and move the apple on the kitchen table
