Your primary goal is to: Put the pudding and the cake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, and move the cake in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the pudding in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pudding, and find the fridge and put down the pudding.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pudding, find the fridge and put down the pudding
