Your primary goal is to: Home service robot, please put 1 wine, 1 pound cake, 1 pudding, 1 apple and 1 pancake into the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the wine in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and and move the pancake in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the wine in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine, and find the fridge and put down the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine, find the fridge and put down the wine
