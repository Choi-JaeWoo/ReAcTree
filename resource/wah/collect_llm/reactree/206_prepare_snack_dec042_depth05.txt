Your primary goal is to: and pour a juice
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the juice, and find the coffee table and put down the juice.
Your task is to: find and pick up the juice
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1). You hold pudding (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the juice in one of the rooms. The juice is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice in kitchen 1, find and pick up the juice in living room 1, find and pick up the juice in bedroom 1
