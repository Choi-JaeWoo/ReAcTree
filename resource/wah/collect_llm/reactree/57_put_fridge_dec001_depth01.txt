Your task is to: Please put the apple, the pancake and the pudding in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and move the pancake in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge
