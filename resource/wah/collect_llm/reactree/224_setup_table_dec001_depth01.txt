Your task is to: Prepare me a plate, a glass of wine and a glass of water for me at the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Prepare a plate, prepare a glass of wine, and prepare a glass of water.
