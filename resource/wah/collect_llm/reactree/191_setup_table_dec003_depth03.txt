Your primary goal is to: Put a wine glass, water glass, and a plate on the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the wine glass on the table, move the water glass on the table, and move the plate on the table.
Your task is to: move the wine glass on the table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine glass, and find the table and put down the wine glass.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine glass, find the table and put down the wine glass
