Your primary goal is to: I need you to store the following food items in the fridge:
- 1 pancake
- 1 wine
- 1 cupcake
- 1 pudding
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: store the pancake in the fridge, store the wine in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, and and store the pudding in the fridge.
Your task is to: store the pancake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the pancake in one of the rooms. The pancake is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the pancake.
OK.
