Your task is to: put 1 apple, 1 pancake , 1 cupcake and 1 jucie in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge
