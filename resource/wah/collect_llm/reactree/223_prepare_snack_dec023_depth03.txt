Your primary goal is to: Take a pudding, an apple, a cupcake, and the juice and put them on the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the apple on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and and move the juice on the coffee table.
Your task is to: move the apple on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (3), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the apple, and find the coffee table and put down the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find the coffee table and put down the apple
