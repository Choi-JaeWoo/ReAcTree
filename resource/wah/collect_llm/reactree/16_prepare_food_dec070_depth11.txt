Your primary goal is to: move the pudding out of the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the pudding, and find the kitchen counter and put down the pudding.
Your task is to: find and pick up the pudding
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the pudding in one of the rooms. The pudding is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the pudding.
OK.
