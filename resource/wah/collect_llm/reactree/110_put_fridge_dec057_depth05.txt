Your primary goal is to: and move the wine in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the wine, and find the fridge and put down the wine.
Your task is to: find and pick up the wine
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the wine in one of the rooms. The wine is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine in kitchen 1, find and pick up the wine in living room 1, find and pick up the wine in bedroom 1
