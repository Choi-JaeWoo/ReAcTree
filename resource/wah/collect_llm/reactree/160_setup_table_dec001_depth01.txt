Your task is to: Collect one cutlery fork, one wine glass and one plate and place it on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the cutlery fork on the kitchen table, move the wine glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
