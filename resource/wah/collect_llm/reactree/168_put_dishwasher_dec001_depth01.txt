Your task is to: get a water glass
open the dishwasher
put the water glass in the dishwasher
close the dishwasher
turn on the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Open the dishwasher, put the water glass in the dishwasher, close the dishwasher, and turn on the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: open the dishwasher, put the water glass in the dishwasher, close the dishwasher, turn on the dishwasher
