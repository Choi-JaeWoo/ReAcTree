Your task is to: Please put the apple and the wine and the pudding on the coffee table in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and move the pudding in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and move the pudding in the fridge
