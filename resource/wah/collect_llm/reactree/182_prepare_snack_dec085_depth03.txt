Your primary goal is to: Please place an apple, a cupcake and a juice on top of the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the apple on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and move the juice on the coffee table.
Your task is to: move the juice on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the juice, and find the coffee table and put down the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice, find the coffee table and put down the juice
