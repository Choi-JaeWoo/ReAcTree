Your task is to: Put apple, coffee pot and a pudding from the fridge and put them on the table in the kitchen.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and move the pudding in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge
