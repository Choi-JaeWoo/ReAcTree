Your primary goal is to: Go put the pudding, juice, cupcake and apple on the  table 
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the pudding on the table, move the juice on the table, move the cupcake on the table, and and move the apple on the table.
Your task is to: move the juice on the table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the juice, and find the table and put down the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice, find the table and put down the juice
