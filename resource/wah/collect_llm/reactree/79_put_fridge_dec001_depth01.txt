Your task is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 pancake, 1 wine, and 1 pudding in the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the cupcake in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the wine in the fridge, and move the pudding in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the cupcake in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the wine in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge
