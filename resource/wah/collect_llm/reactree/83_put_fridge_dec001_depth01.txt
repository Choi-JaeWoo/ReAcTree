Your task is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, 1 pancake, 1 wine, and 1 apple in the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 5 subgoals independently. Find and open the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, and move the apple in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, and move the apple in the fridge
