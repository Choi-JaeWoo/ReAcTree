Your task is to: Bring 1 apple, 1 wine, 1 cupcake and 1 juice to the kitchen table and leave it on the table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), closet (3, 4), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the apple on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, and move the juice on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the cupcake on the kitchen table, and move the juice on the kitchen table
