Your task is to: Take the dirty cutlery fork, wine glass and a plate from the table and put them into the dishwasher and turn it on.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher
