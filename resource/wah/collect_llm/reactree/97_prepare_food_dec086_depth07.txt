Your primary goal is to: find and pick up the juice
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the juice in kitchen 1, find and pick up the juice in living room 1, and find and pick up the juice in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: find and pick up the juice in kitchen 1
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: I am in kitchen 1. Now, I need to find the juice. The juice is more likely to appear on kitchen table (1), or in fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). I can check each place one by one, starting from kitchen table 1, until I find the juice.
OK.
Act: go to kitchen table 1
You arrive at the kitchen table (1). You see bench (2), book (1), bowl (6), cell phone (1), condiment shaker (1, 2), cupcake (1), kitchen table (1)

You arrive at the fridge (1). The fridge (1) is open. You see bench (1), fridge (1), juice (1), kitchen table (1), pancake (1), pudding (1)
Think: I find juice 1. Now I need to pick it up.
OK.
Act: pick up juice 1
You pick up juice. You hold juice (1).
Think: Now I accomplish the goal.
OK.
