Your primary goal is to: Go into the kitchen and find 1 cutlery fork,1 water glass and 1 plate in the cupboards.When you have found them carry them and place each item on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cutlery fork, find and pick up the water glass, and find and pick up the plate.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cutlery fork
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the cutlery fork in one of the rooms. The cutlery fork is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the cutlery fork.
OK.
