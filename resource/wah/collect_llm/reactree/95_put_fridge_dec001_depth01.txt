Your task is to: Put 1 wine and 1 apple in the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the wine in the fridge, and move the apple in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine in the fridge, move the apple in the fridge
