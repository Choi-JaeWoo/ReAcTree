Your primary goal is to: locate 1 green apple, 1 pancake, 1 pound cake, and 1 grapefruit juice on the kitchen table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the green apple, find and pick up the pancake, find and pick up the pound cake, and find and pick up the grapefruit juice.
Your task is to: find and pick up the green apple
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the green apple in one of the rooms. The green apple is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the green apple.
OK.
