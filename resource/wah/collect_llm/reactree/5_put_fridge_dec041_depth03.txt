Your primary goal is to: Take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: take an apple from the basket, come to the fridge, open the door and put the apple into there. Then come back, and take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge..
Your task is to: take the 1 pound cake and 1 juice and also put them into the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice, and find the fridge and put down the 1 pound cake and 1 juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the 1 pound cake and 1 juice, find the fridge and put down the 1 pound cake and 1 juice
