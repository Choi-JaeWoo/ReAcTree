Your primary goal is to: put 1 apple, 1 pancake , 1 cupcake and 1 jucie in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, and move the juice in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the cupcake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cupcake, and find the fridge and put down the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake, find the fridge and put down the cupcake
