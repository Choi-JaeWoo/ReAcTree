Your primary goal is to: and 1 plate and remember their location
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and remember the location of 1 cutlery fork, find and remember the location of 1 water glass, and and find and remember the location of 1 plate.
Your task is to: and find and remember the location of 1 plate
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and remember the location of 1 plate. The plate is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, bedroom 1, or bedroom 2. I can check each room one by one until I find and remember the location of 1 plate.
OK.
