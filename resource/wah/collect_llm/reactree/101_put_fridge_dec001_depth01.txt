Your task is to: Put 1 juice and 1 pound cake in the fridge.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Find and open the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, and move the pound cake in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge
