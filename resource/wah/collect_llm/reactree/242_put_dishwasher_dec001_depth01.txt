Your task is to: Robot, put 1 cutlery fork, 1 wine glass, 1 water glass and 1 plate in the dishwasher and turn the dishwasher on
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2, 3, 4), bookshelf (1, 2), chair (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (2), kitchen table (1, 2), microwave oven (1), sink (1), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, and close and turn on the dishwasher
