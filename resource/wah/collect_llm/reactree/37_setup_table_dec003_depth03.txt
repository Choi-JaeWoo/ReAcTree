Your primary goal is to: Go into the kitchen. Go to the kitchen table and move it 1 cutlery fork, 1 wine glass, and 1 plate on the dining table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cutlery fork on the dining table, and move the wine glass on the dining table.
Your task is to: move the cutlery fork on the dining table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), closet (3, 4), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cutlery fork, and find the dining table and put down the cutlery fork.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cutlery fork, find the dining table and put down the cutlery fork
