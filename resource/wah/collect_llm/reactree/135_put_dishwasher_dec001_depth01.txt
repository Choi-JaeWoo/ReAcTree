Your task is to: wash the cutlery fork,  wine glass,  water glass, and plate that are in the dishwasher
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Wash the cutlery fork, wash the wine glass, wash the water glass, and wash the plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: wash the cutlery fork, wash the wine glass, wash the water glass, wash the plate
