Your primary goal is to: wash the cutlery fork,  wine glass,  water glass, and plate that are in the dishwasher
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: wash the cutlery fork, wash the wine glass, wash the water glass, and wash the plate.
Your task is to: wash the plate
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the plate, and find the dishwasher and put down the plate.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the plate, find the dishwasher and put down the plate
