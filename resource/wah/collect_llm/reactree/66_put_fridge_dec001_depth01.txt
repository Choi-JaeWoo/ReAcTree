Your task is to: Put the pudding and the cake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Find and open the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, and move the cake in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, move the cake in the fridge
