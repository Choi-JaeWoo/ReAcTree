Your primary goal is to: Put 1 cupcake, 1 pancake, 1 pudding, and 1 apple in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and open the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, move the pancake in the fridge, move the pudding in the fridge, and and move the apple in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the pudding in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pudding, and find the fridge and put down the pudding.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pudding, find the fridge and put down the pudding
