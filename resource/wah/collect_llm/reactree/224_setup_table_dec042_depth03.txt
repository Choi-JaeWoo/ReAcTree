Your primary goal is to: Prepare me a plate, a glass of wine and a glass of water for me at the kitchen table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: prepare a plate, prepare a glass of wine, and prepare a glass of water.
Your task is to: prepare a glass of water
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the glass of water, and find the kitchen table and put down the glass of water.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the glass of water, find the kitchen table and put down the glass of water
