Your primary goal is to: find and pick up the cupcake
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the cupcake in kitchen 1, find and pick up the cupcake in living room 1, and find and pick up the cupcake in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: find and pick up the cupcake in kitchen 1
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: I am in kitchen 1. Now, I need to find the cupcake. The cupcake is more likely to appear on kitchen table (1), or in fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). I can check each place one by one, starting from kitchen table 1, until I find the cupcake.
OK.
Act: go to kitchen table 1
You arrive at the kitchen table (1). You see apple (2), bananas (1, 2), bowl (2), chair (4, 5), coffee pot (1), condiment shaker (1, 2), cupcake (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (5), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), mug (2, 3), pancake (2), pie (1), pudding (2), wine (1)
Think: I find cupcake 1. Now, I need to pick it up.
OK.
Act: pick up cupcake 1
You pick up cupcake. You hold cupcake (1).
Think: Now I accomplish the goal.
OK.
