Your task is to: I need one glass of wine, one glass of water and one plate.
Bring them on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1), coffee table (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the water glass on the kitchen table, and move the plate on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the wine glass on the kitchen table, move the water glass on the kitchen table, move the plate on the kitchen table
