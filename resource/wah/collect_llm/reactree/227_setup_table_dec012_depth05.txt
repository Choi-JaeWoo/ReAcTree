Your primary goal is to: move the fork in the cupboard
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the fork, and find the cupboard and put down the fork.
Your task is to: find and pick up the fork
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (1), chair (2, 3, 4, 5), dishwasher (1), faucet (1), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (1), sofa (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the fork in one of the rooms. The fork is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the fork.
OK.

- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the fork in kitchen 1, find and pick up the fork in living room 1, find and pick up the fork in bedroom 1
