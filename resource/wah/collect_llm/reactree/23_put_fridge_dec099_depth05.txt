Your primary goal is to: move the juice in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the juice, and find the fridge and put down the juice.
Your task is to: find and pick up the juice
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (5), chair (2), desk (1), nightstand (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the juice in one of the rooms. The juice is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, bedroom 1, or bedroom 2. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the juice.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the juice in kitchen 1, find and pick up the juice in living room 1, find and pick up the juice in bedroom 1, find and pick up the juice in bedroom 2
