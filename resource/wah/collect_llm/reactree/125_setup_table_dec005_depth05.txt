Your primary goal is to: move the water glass on the table
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in sequence. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the water glass, and find the table and put down the water glass.
Your task is to: find and pick up the water glass
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the water glass in one of the rooms. The water glass is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the water glass.
OK.
