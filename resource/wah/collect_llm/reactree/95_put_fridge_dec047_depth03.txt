Your primary goal is to: Put 1 wine and 1 apple in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the wine in the fridge, and move the apple in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the apple in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the apple, and find the fridge and put down the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find the fridge and put down the apple
