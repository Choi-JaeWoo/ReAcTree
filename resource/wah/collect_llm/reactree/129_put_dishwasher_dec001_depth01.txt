Your task is to: Put in the  water glass first, before the wine glass, then the cutlery fork and then the plates on the dishwasher.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 2), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the water glass in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, and move the plates in the dishwasher.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the water glass in the dishwasher, move the wine glass in the dishwasher, move the cutlery fork in the dishwasher, and move the plates in the dishwasher
