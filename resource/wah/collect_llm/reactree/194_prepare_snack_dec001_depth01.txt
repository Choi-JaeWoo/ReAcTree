Your task is to: pick up an apple
put apple on the coffee table
pick up cupcake 
put cupcake on the coffee table
pick up pudding dish
set dish onto the table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Find and pick up the apple, move the apple on the coffee table, and find and pick up the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, move the apple on the coffee table, find and pick up the cupcake
