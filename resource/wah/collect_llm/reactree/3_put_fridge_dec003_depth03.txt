Your primary goal is to: put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge in kitchen 1, put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and 1 pancake in the fridge in living room 1, put 1 cupcake, 1 juice, and and 1 pancake in the fridge in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: put 1 cupcake
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), cabinet (1), chair (6), closet (2), nightstand (2), sofa (3).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cupcake, and find the fridge and put down the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake, find the fridge and put down the cupcake
