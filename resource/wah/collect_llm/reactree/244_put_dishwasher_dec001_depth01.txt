Your task is to: Please put the fork and the wine and water glasses I left out, into the washer and press run?
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Find and open the washer, move the fork in the washer, move the wine glass in the washer, and close and turn on the washer.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: find and open the washer, move the fork in the washer, move the wine glass in the washer, close and turn on the washer
