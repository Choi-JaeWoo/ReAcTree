Your primary goal is to: Get me a pudding, an apple and pour me a juice and bring it to the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: get a pudding, get an apple, and and pour a juice.
Your task is to: get an apple
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), chair (2), closet (1), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (2), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to find and pick up the apple in one of the rooms. The apple is more likely to appear in kitchen 1, living room 1, or bedroom 1. I can check each room one by one until I find and pick up the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: fallback
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple in kitchen 1, find and pick up the apple in living room 1, find and pick up the apple in bedroom 1
