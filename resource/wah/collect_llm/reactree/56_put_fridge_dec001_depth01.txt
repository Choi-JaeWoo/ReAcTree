Your task is to: Store the juice, wine, cupcake and apple in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Store the juice in the fridge, store the wine in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, and store the apple in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: store the juice in the fridge, store the wine in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, and store the apple in the fridge
