Your task is to: Put the apple and cupcake on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (2), cabinet (1), chair (1), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), nightstand (1, 2), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the apple on the coffee table, and move the cupcake on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table
