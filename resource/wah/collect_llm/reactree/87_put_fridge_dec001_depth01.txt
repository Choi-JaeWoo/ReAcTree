Your task is to: Store the apple, cupcake, pudding and cake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (1), dishwasher (1), faucet (2), fridge (1), garbage can (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), kitchen counter (1, 3), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Store the apple in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, store the pudding in the fridge, and store the cake in the fridge.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: store the apple in the fridge, store the cupcake in the fridge, store the pudding in the fridge, and store the cake in the fridge
