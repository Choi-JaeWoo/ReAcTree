Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine, and find the coffee table and put down the wine.
OK.
