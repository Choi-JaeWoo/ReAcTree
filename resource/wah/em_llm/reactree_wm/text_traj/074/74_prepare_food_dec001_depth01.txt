Your task is to: Put 1 pancake, 1 wine, 1 apple, and 1 coffee pot on the kitchen table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (1), bookshelf (1), chair (1, 2), closet (1, 2), coffee table (1), computer (1), desk (1), garbage can (1), nightstand (1, 2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pancake on the kitchen table, move the wine on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the coffee pot on the kitchen table
