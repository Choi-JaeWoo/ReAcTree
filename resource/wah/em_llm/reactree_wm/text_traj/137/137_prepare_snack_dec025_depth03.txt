Your primary goal is to: Get me a cupcake and a pudding and bring it to the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cupcake on the coffee table, and move the pudding on the coffee table.
Your task is to: move the pudding on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pudding, and find the coffee table and put down the pudding.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pudding, find the coffee table and put down the pudding
