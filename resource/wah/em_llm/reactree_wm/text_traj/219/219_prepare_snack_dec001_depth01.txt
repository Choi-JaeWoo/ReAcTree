Your task is to: Put 1 pudding and 1 apple on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (3), coffee table (2), computer (2), desk (2), sofa (1), tv (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the coffee table, and move the apple on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the apple on the coffee table
