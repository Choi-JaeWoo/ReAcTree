Your task is to: Please open the dishwasher.  Put the wine glass in the dishwasher.  Set the dishwasher off on the normal cycle.
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Open the dishwasher, put the wine glass in the dishwasher, and set the dishwasher off on the normal cycle.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: open the dishwasher, put the wine glass in the dishwasher, set the dishwasher off on the normal cycle
