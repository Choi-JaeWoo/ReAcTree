Your primary goal is to: Robot, could you please put the apple and cupcake inside the fridge?
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the apple in the fridge, and move the cupcake in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the apple in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (2), sink (2), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the apple, and find the fridge and put down the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find the fridge and put down the apple
