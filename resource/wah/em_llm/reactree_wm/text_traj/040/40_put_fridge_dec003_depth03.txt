Your primary goal is to: Put a cupcake, a juice, a pound cake, an apple and a pancake in the fridge.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the cupcake in the fridge, move the juice in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge, move the apple in the fridge, and and move the pancake in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the cupcake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the cupcake, and find the fridge and put down the cupcake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the cupcake, find the fridge and put down the cupcake
