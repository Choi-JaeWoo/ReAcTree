Your task is to: put a pudding, juice and glass of wine in the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the coffee table, move the juice on the coffee table, and move the wine glass on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the juice on the coffee table, and move the wine glass on the coffee table
