Your task is to: Put an apple, a wine, a cupcake and a juice on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 4 subgoals independently. Move the apple on the coffee table, move the wine on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and move the juice on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the apple on the coffee table, move the wine on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, move the juice on the coffee table
