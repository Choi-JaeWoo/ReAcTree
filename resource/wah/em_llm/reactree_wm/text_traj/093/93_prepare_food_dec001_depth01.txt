Your task is to: Please put pudding, apple and juice on the kitchen table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the juice on the kitchen table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the kitchen table, move the apple on the kitchen table, and move the juice on the kitchen table
