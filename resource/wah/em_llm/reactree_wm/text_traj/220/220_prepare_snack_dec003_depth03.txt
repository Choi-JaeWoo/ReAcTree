Your primary goal is to: Place one apple, one cupcake and one juice on the coffee table.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the apple on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and and move the juice on the coffee table.
Your task is to: move the apple on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bedroom (2). Looking quickly around the room, you see bed (2), bookshelf (6), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (1), computer (1), desk (2), garbage can (1), nightstand (2).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the apple, and find the coffee table and put down the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find the coffee table and put down the apple
