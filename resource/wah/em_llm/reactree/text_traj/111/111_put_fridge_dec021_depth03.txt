Your primary goal is to: Robot, please go get 1 apple, 1 pound cake, 1 cupcake and 1 juice and put them in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the apple in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, and move the juice in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the pound cake in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the pound cake, and find the fridge and put down the pound cake.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the pound cake, find the fridge and put down the pound cake
