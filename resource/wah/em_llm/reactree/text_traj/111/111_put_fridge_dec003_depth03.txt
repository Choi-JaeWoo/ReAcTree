Your primary goal is to: Robot, please go get 1 apple, 1 pound cake, 1 cupcake and 1 juice and put them in the fridge
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the apple in the fridge, move the pound cake in the fridge, move the cupcake in the fridge, and move the juice in the fridge.
Your task is to: move the apple in the fridge
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a bathroom (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bathroom cabinet (1), bathroom counter (1), faucet (1), sink (1), toilet (1), towel rack (1, 2, 3, 4), washing machine (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the apple, and find the fridge and put down the apple.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the apple, find the fridge and put down the apple
