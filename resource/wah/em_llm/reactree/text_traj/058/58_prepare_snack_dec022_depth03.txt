Your primary goal is to: Go to the kitchen and collect the following items from the kitchen table and carry them to the coffee table in the lounge:1 pudding, 1 bottle of wine, 1 apple and 1 juice drink.
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks in parallel. At this level, your sibling tasks are: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the wine on the coffee table, move the apple on the coffee table, and move the juice drink on the coffee table.
Your task is to: move the wine on the coffee table
You are in the house, and there are 5 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1, 2), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3, 4), coffee table (1), sofa (1), tv (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 2 subgoals sequentially. Find and pick up the wine, and find the coffee table and put down the wine.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: sequence
- subgoals: find and pick up the wine, find the coffee table and put down the wine
