Your task is to: Please get me a pudding, a cupcake and one cup of juice and put it on the coffee table.
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a living room (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bookshelf (3), cabinet (1), chair (3), closet (2), coffee table (2), computer (1), desk (1), sofa (1).
Think: To solve the task, I need to accomplish 3 subgoals independently. Move the pudding on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and move the cup of juice on the coffee table.
OK.
Expand:
- control flow: parallel
- subgoals: move the pudding on the coffee table, move the cupcake on the coffee table, and move the cup of juice on the coffee table
