Your primary goal is to: find and pick up the wine
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the wine in kitchen 1, find and pick up the wine in living room 1, and find and pick up the wine in bedroom 1.
Your task is to: find and pick up the wine in kitchen 1
You are in the house, and there are 4 rooms: bathroom (1), bedroom (1), kitchen (1), living room (1). You are in the middle of a kitchen (1). Looking quickly around the room, you see bench (1, 2), bookshelf (2), faucet (2), fridge (1), kitchen counter (1), kitchen table (1), microwave oven (1), sink (2), stove (1), toaster (1), tv (1).
Think: I am in kitchen 1. Now, I need to find the wine. The wine is more likely to appear on kitchen table (1), or in fridge (1), kitchen cabinet (1, 2, 3, 4). I can check each place one by one, starting from kitchen table 1, until I find the wine.
OK.
