Your primary goal is to: find and pick up the juice
To achieve this, you should perform your sibling tasks using a fallback strategy. At this level, your sibling tasks are: find and pick up the juice in kitchen 1, find and pick up the juice in living room 1, find and pick up the juice in bedroom 1, and find and pick up the juice in bedroom 2.
